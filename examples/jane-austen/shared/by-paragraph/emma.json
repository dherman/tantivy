Even\nbefore Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess,\nthe mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any\nrestraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they\nhad been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached,\nand Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor’s\njudgment, but directed chiefly by her own."

The want\nof Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her\npast kindness—the kindness, the affection of sixteen years—how she had\ntaught and how she had played with her from five years old—how she had\ndevoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health—and how nursed\nher through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of\ngratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years,\nthe equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed\nIsabella’s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a\ndearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such\nas few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing\nall the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and\npeculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of\nhers—one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had\nsuch an affection for her as could never find fault."

The Woodhouses were\nfirst in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many\nacquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but\nnot one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for\neven half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but\nsigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke,\nand made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He\nwas a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was\nused to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.\nMatrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was\nby no means yet reconciled to his own daughter’s marrying, nor could\never speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a\nmatch of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor\ntoo; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able\nto suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he\nwas very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for\nherself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she\nhad spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and\nchatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but\nwhen tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had\nsaid at dinner,"

She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,\nwho had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to\nthe occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to\nMr. Woodhouse’s kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her\nneat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win\nor lose a few sixpences by his fireside."

Those soft blue eyes, and all those\nnatural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of\nHighbury and its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed\nwere unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though\nvery good sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of\nthe name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a\nlarge farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell—very\ncreditably, she believed—she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of\nthem—but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the\nintimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and\nelegance to be quite perfect. _She_ would notice her; she would improve\nher; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her\ninto good society; she would form her opinions and her manners.

I hope, with all my heart, the\nyoung man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.—But\nHarriet Smith—I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her the\nvery worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows\nnothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a\nflatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned.\nHer ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any\nthing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful\ninferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that _she_\ncannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of\nconceit with all the other places she belongs to. She will grow just\nrefined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and\ncircumstances have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma’s\ndoctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl\nadapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in\nlife.—They only give a little polish.”"

She was so eager to have them\ndrawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three\nor four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take\nany likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are\ncoarser featured than any of mama’s children ever were. Here is my\nsketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on\nthe sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would\nwish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That’s\nvery like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa\nis very good. Then here is my last,”—unclosing a pretty sketch of a\ngentleman in small size, whole-length—“my last and my best—my brother,\nMr. John Knightley.—This did not want much of being finished, when I\nput it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I\ncould not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had\nreally made a very good likeness of it—(Mrs. Weston and I were quite\nagreed in thinking it _very_ like)—only too handsome—too flattering—but\nthat was a fault on the right side”—after all this, came poor dear\nIsabella’s cold approbation of—“Yes, it was a little like—but to be\nsure it did not do him justice. We had had a great deal of trouble in\npersuading him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and\naltogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish\nit, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every\nmorning visitor in Brunswick Square;—and, as I said, I did then\nforswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet’s sake, or rather\nfor my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_\n_present_, I will break my resolution now.”"

He came to ask me whether I\nthought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether I\nthought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice\naltogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered\n(especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line of society\nabove him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear\nbetter sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the\npurpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every\nthing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in\nthe event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son\nand brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to\nme that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he\ncould not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent\nhim away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he\nwould have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house\nthinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened\nthe night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not\nallow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not\nappear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be\nat Mrs. Goddard’s to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without\nthinking him at all a tiresome wretch.”"

Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are\nHarriet Smith’s claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any\nconnexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of\nnobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and\ncertainly no respectable relations. She is known only as\nparlour-boarder at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a\ngirl of any information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too\nyoung and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she\ncan have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely\never to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good\ntempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on\nhis account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.\nI felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better;\nand that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do\nworse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to\ntrust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of\ndisposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright\nand turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on\nher side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there\nwould be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even _your_\nsatisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you\nwould not regret your friend’s leaving Highbury, for the sake of her\nbeing settled so well.

But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin, it is\nimpossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must\nprevent any second application. She must abide by the evil of having\nrefused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will\nnot pretend to say that I might not influence her a little; but I\nassure you there was very little for me or for any body to do. His\nappearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if she\never were disposed to favour him, she is not now. I can imagine, that\nbefore she had seen any body superior, she might tolerate him. He was\nthe brother of her friends, and he took pains to please her; and\naltogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his great\nassistant) she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him\ndisagreeable. But the case is altered now. She knows now what gentlemen\nare; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance\nwith Harriet.”"

She\nwas not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and\nthe return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet’s\nstaying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility\nof the young man’s coming to Mrs. Goddard’s that morning, and meeting\nwith Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread\nof such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when\nHarriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such\nreason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which\nsettled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.\nKnightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which\nwoman’s friendship and woman’s feelings would not justify."

Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very\nsmall, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and\ncross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too\ngood natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very\nmuch to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty\ncertainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had\nonly a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away\nsixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm.”"

To walk by the side of this child, and talk\nto and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would\nhave been the most natural, had she been acting just then without\ndesign; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead,\nwithout any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,\ninvoluntarily: the child’s pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; and\nshe was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in a\nconversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with\nanimation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,\nhaving sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw\nback a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged\nto join them."

I am as\nconfident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of\nbeing here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the\nupper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so\nlittle used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their\neffects, as I have been long in the practice of doing.”"

But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.\nI have been but half a friend to her; and if she were _not_ to feel\nthis disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any\nbody else who would be at all desirable for her;—William Coxe—Oh! no, I\ncould not endure William Coxe—a pert young lawyer.”"

    "text": "“Thank you. You are so kind!” replied the happily deceived aunt, while\neagerly hunting for the letter.—“Oh! here it is. I was sure it could\nnot be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without\nbeing aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very\nlately that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it\nto Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my\nmother, for it is such a pleasure to her—a letter from Jane—that she\ncan never hear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and\nhere it is, only just under my huswife—and since you are so kind as to\nwish to hear what she says;—but, first of all, I really must, in\njustice to Jane, apologise for her writing so short a letter—only two\npages you see—hardly two—and in general she fills the whole paper and\ncrosses half. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.\nShe often says, when the letter is first opened, ‘Well, Hetty, now I\nthink you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work’—don’t\nyou, ma’am?—And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make\nit out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her—every word of it—I\nam sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word. And,\nindeed, though my mother’s eyes are not so good as they were, she can\nsee amazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is\nsuch a blessing! My mother’s are really very good indeed. Jane often\nsays, when she is here, ‘I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very\nstrong eyes to see as you do—and so much fine work as you have done\ntoo!—I only wish my eyes may last me as well.’”"

I always make a point of reading Jane’s letters through\nto myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for\nfear of there being any thing in them to distress her.

However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had\nfancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she does\nnot think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my\nguard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The\nexpense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so\nfond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for\nattendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know.

    "text": "The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a\nresolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, no\nexertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and\nfor their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this\nwould be selfishness:—what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps\nthey began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted\nthe temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such\nenjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still,\nhowever, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not\nhurrying on the wretched moment. She had never been quite well since\nthe time of their daughter’s marriage; and till she should have\ncompletely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging\nin duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame\nand varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances,\nto require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be\ndischarged with tolerable comfort."

It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to\nHighbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with\nthose kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,\nwhatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double,\nor treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that\nthey depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the\nrecovery of her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that she\nwas to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect\nnovelty which had been so long promised it—Mr. Frank Churchill—must put\nup for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the\nfreshness of a two years’ absence."

Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a\ndifficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was\nbecause she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she\nwanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been\neagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in\nwhich her conscience could not quite acquit her. But “she could never\nget acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was\nsuch coldness and reserve—such apparent indifference whether she\npleased or not—and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!—and she\nwas made such a fuss with by every body!—and it had been always\nimagined that they were to be so intimate—because their ages were the\nsame, every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other.”\nThese were her reasons—she had no better."

    "text": "It was a dislike so little just—every imputed fault was so magnified by\nfancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any\nconsiderable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and\nnow, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years’\ninterval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and\nmanners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.\nJane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself\nthe highest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as\nalmost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall;\nher figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium,\nbetween fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed\nto point out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all\nthis; and then, her face—her features—there was more beauty in them\naltogether than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very\npleasing beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and\neyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she\nhad been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and\ndelicacy which really needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty,\nof which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she must, in\nhonour, by all her principles, admire it:—elegance, which, whether of\nperson or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be\nvulgar, was distinction, and merit."

When\nshe took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty;\nwhen she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she\nwas going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible\nto feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every\nwell-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly\nprobable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so\nnaturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more\npitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.\nEmma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon’s\naffections from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her\nimagination had suggested at first. If it were love, it might be\nsimple, single, successless love on her side alone. She might have been\nunconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his\nconversation with her friend; and from the best, the purest of motives,\nmight now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to\ndivide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon\nbeginning her career of laborious duty."

Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome\nas ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to\nadmiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of\nexactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how\nsmall a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of\nnew caps and new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane’s\noffences rose again. They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the\nthanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an\naffectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew off\nin higher style her own very superior performance. She was, besides,\nwhich was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious! There was no getting\nat her real opinion. Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed\ndetermined to hazard nothing. She was disgustingly, was suspiciously\nreserved."

As the blow\nwas given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than\nin listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had\nto tell. “She had set out from Mrs. Goddard’s half an hour ago—she had\nbeen afraid it would rain—she had been afraid it would pour down every\nmoment—but she thought she might get to Hartfield first—she had hurried\non as fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by the house where\na young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she would just\nstep in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay\nhalf a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain, and she\ndid not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as she could,\nand took shelter at Ford’s.”—Ford’s was the principal woollen-draper,\nlinen-draper, and haberdasher’s shop united; the shop first in size and\nfashion in the place.—“And so, there she had set, without an idea of\nany thing in the world, full ten minutes, perhaps—when, all of a\nsudden, who should come in—to be sure it was so very odd!—but they\nalways dealt at Ford’s—who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her\nbrother!—Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. I thought I should have\nfainted. I did not know what to do. I was sitting near the\ndoor—Elizabeth saw me directly; but he did not; he was busy with the\numbrella. I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took\nno notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop; and\nI kept sitting near the door!—Oh! dear; I was so miserable! I am sure I\nmust have been as white as my gown. I could not go away you know,\nbecause of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but\nthere.—Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse—well, at last, I fancy, he looked round\nand saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, they began\nwhispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; and I\ncould not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me—(do\nyou think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)—for presently she came forward—came\nquite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake\nhands, if I would. She did not do any of it in the same way that she\nused; I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to\nbe very friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but\nI know no more what I said—I was in such a tremble!—I remember she said\nshe was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear,\nMiss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was\nbeginning to hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me\nfrom getting away—and then—only think!—I found he was coming up towards\nme too—slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and\nso he came and spoke, and I answered—and I stood for a minute, feeling\ndreadfully, you know, one can’t tell how; and then I took courage, and\nsaid it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not\ngot three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I\nwas going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr.\nCole’s stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this\nrain. Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I\nsaid, I was very much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and\nthen he went back to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables—I\nbelieve I did—but I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh!\nMiss Woodhouse, I would rather done any thing than have it happen: and\nyet, you know, there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so\npleasantly and so kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do\ntalk to me and make me comfortable again.”"

As\nto connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all\nhis own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. On\nthat article, truth seemed attainable. _What_ she was, must be\nuncertain; but _who_ she was, might be found out; and setting aside the\n10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at all Harriet’s superior.\nShe brought no name, no blood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the\nyoungest of the two daughters of a Bristol—merchant, of course, he must\nbe called; but, as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life\nappeared so very moderate, it was not unfair to guess the dignity of\nhis line of trade had been very moderate also. Part of every winter she\nhad been used to spend in Bath; but Bristol was her home, the very\nheart of Bristol; for though the father and mother had died some years\nago, an uncle remained—in the law line—nothing more distinctly\nhonourable was hazarded of him, than that he was in the law line; and\nwith him the daughter had lived. Emma guessed him to be the drudge of\nsome attorney, and too stupid to rise. And all the grandeur of the\nconnexion seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was _very_ _well_\n_married_, to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_, near Bristol, who kept\ntwo carriages! That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory\nof Miss Hawkins."

Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always\nin love. And now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from this\nreappearance of Mr. Elton.

She was, moreover, perpetually\nhearing about him; for, excepting when at Hartfield, she was always\namong those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so\ninteresting as the discussion of his concerns; and every report,\ntherefore, every guess—all that had already occurred, all that might\noccur in the arrangement of his affairs, comprehending income,\nservants, and furniture, was continually in agitation around her. Her\nregard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her\nregrets kept alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of\nMiss Hawkins’s happiness, and continual observation of, how much he\nseemed attached!—his air as he walked by the house—the very sitting of\nhis hat, being all in proof of how much he was in love!"

But Mr.\nElton, in person, had driven away all such cares.

There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot\nby the window. _He_ had done it. They all seemed to remember the day,\nthe hour, the party, the occasion—to feel the same consciousness, the\nsame regrets—to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and\nthey were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must\nsuspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,) when\nthe carriage reappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and\nthe shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to\nbe given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six\nmonths ago!—Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they\nmight resent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business.\nShe would have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had\nthe Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so deserving, that a\n_little_ higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could she\nhave done otherwise?—Impossible!—She could not repent. They must be\nseparated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process—so much to\nherself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a little\nconsolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure\nit. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The\nrefreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary."

Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of\npassing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed\nwindows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities,\nand lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He saw no\nfault in the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested. No,\nit was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold the\nvery number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every\nfortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the\nformer good old days of the room?—She who could do any thing in\nHighbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction\nthat none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted\nto attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not be\npersuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could\nnot furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when\nparticulars were given and families described, he was still unwilling\nto admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing,\nor that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body’s\nreturning into their proper place the next morning. He argued like a\nyoung man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to\nsee the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the\nhabits of the Churchills. He seemed to have all the life and spirit,\ncheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his father, and nothing\nof the pride or reserve of Enscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was,\nperhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank,\nbordered too much on inelegance of mind. He could be no judge, however,\nof the evil he was holding cheap. It was but an effusion of lively\nspirits."

But Emma, in her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he\nwas talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to\nsettle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives. He might not\nbe aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no\nhousekeeper’s room, or a bad butler’s pantry, but no doubt he did\nperfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy, and that\nwhenever he were attached, he would willingly give up much of wealth to\nbe allowed an early establishment."

    "text": "Emma’s very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the\nfollowing day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely to\nhave his hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at\nbreakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to\nreturn to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than\nhaving his hair cut. There was certainly no harm in his travelling\nsixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air of\nfoppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve. It did not\naccord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or even\nthe unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself to\ndiscern in him yesterday. Vanity, extravagance, love of change,\nrestlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad;\nheedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston,\nindifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became\nliable to all these charges. His father only called him a coxcomb, and\nthought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, was\nclear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, and making\nno other comment than that “all young people would have their little\nwhims.”"

Mrs. Weston was\nvery ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made\nhimself—how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. He\nappeared to have a very open temper—certainly a very cheerful and\nlively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great\ndeal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond\nof talking of him—said he would be the best man in the world if he were\nleft to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he\nacknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to\nspeak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for\nsuch an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to\ndenote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination\nhad given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of\nbeing at least very near it, and saved only by her own\nindifference—(for still her resolution held of never marrying)—the\nhonour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint\nacquaintance."

On their first coming into the\ncountry, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping\nlittle company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two\nhad brought them a considerable increase of means—the house in town had\nyielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them.\nWith their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house,\ntheir inclination for more company. They added to their house, to their\nnumber of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time\nwere, in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at\nHartfield. Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared\nevery body for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly\namong the single men, had already taken place. The regular and best\nfamilies Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite—neither\nDonwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt _her_ to go,\nif they did; and she regretted that her father’s known habits would be\ngiving her refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were\nvery respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was\nnot for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would\nvisit them. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only\nfrom herself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston."

She felt that she should like to have had the power of\nrefusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled\nthere, consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her,\noccurred again and again, she did not know that she might not have been\ntempted to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the\nBateses. They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the\nday before, and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her\nabsence.

The less worthy females were to come in the\nevening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already, at\ndinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be\ngeneral; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma could\nfairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her\nneighbour. The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to\nattend, was the name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating\nsomething of her that was expected to be very interesting. She\nlistened, and found it well worth listening to. That very dear part of\nEmma, her fancy, received an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that\nshe had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room\nhad been struck by the sight of a pianoforte—a very elegant looking\ninstrument—not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the\nsubstance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of\nsurprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and\nexplanations on Miss Bates’s, was, that this pianoforte had arrived\nfrom Broadwood’s the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt\nand niece—entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates’s account,\nJane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could\npossibly have ordered it—but now, they were both perfectly satisfied\nthat it could be from only one quarter;—of course it must be from\nColonel Campbell."

She\nintroduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments\nafterwards, heard what each thought of the other. “He had never seen so\nlovely a face, and was delighted with her naïveté.” And she, “Only to\nbe sure it was paying him too great a compliment, but she did think\nthere were some looks a little like Mr. Elton.” Emma restrained her\nindignation, and only turned from her in silence."

She\nquestioned him as to the society in Yorkshire—the extent of the\nneighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort; and could make out from his\nanswers that, as far as Enscombe was concerned, there was very little\ngoing on, that their visitings were among a range of great families,\nnone very near; and that even when days were fixed, and invitations\naccepted, it was an even chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health\nand spirits for going; that they made a point of visiting no fresh\nperson; and that, though he had his separate engagements, it was not\nwithout difficulty, without considerable address _at_ _times_, that he\ncould get away, or introduce an acquaintance for a night."

And as I looked at her, though I never saw\nher appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and\nwould therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could\nnot bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room,\nand I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You may\nguess how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I\nmade my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage\nwould be at her service before it took us home; for I thought it would\nbe making her comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as\npossible, you may be sure. ‘Nobody was ever so fortunate as\nherself!’—but with many, many thanks—‘there was no occasion to trouble\nus, for Mr. Knightley’s carriage had brought, and was to take them home\nagain.’ I was quite surprized;—very glad, I am sure; but really quite\nsurprized. Such a very kind attention—and so thoughtful an\nattention!—the sort of thing that so few men would think of. And, in\nshort, from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to think\nthat it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do\nsuspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself, and that it\nwas only as an excuse for assisting them.”"

Frank Churchill, of whom, in the\neagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeing\nnothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr.\nCole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it\nsuited Emma best to lead, she gave a very proper compliance."

One accompaniment to her song took her\nagreeably by surprize—a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank\nChurchill. Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and\nevery thing usual followed. He was accused of having a delightful\nvoice, and a perfect knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and\nthat he knew nothing of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly\nasserted. They sang together once more; and Emma would then resign her\nplace to Miss Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental,\nshe never could attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely\nsuperior to her own."

But the\nsight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half\nEmma’s mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of\nMrs. Weston’s suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united\nvoices gave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr.\nKnightley’s marrying did not in the least subside. She could see\nnothing but evil in it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John\nKnightley; consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children—a\nmost mortifying change, and material loss to them all;—a very great\ndeduction from her father’s daily comfort—and, as to herself, she could\nnot at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs.\nKnightley for them all to give way to!—No—Mr. Knightley must never\nmarry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell."

They were stopping, however, in the\nfirst place at Mrs. Bates’s; whose house was a little nearer Randalls\nthan Ford’s; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their\neye.—Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the\nagreeableness of yesterday’s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure\nto the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to\ncall on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument."

Mrs. Weston told me you were here.—Oh!\nthen, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me\njust to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so\nvery happy to see her—and now we are such a nice party, she cannot\nrefuse.—‘Aye, pray do,’ said Mr. Frank Churchill, ‘Miss Woodhouse’s\nopinion of the instrument will be worth having.’—But, said I, I shall\nbe more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.—‘Oh,’ said\nhe, ‘wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;’—For, would you\nbelieve it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in\nthe world, fastening in the rivet of my mother’s spectacles.—The rivet\ncame out, you know, this morning.—So very obliging!—For my mother had\nno use of her spectacles—could not put them on. And, by the bye, every\nbody ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane\nsaid so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I\ndid, but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one\nthing, then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time\nPatty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh,\nsaid I, Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet\nof your mistress’s spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home,\nMrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging\nto us, the Wallises, always—I have heard some people say that Mrs.\nWallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never\nknown any thing but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be\nfor the value of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread,\nyou know? Only three of us.—besides dear Jane at present—and she really\neats nothing—makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite\nfrightened if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she\neats—so I say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But\nabout the middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she\nlikes so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome,\nfor I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I\nhappened to meet him in the street. Not that I had any doubt before—I\nhave so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it\nis the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly\nwholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an\nexcellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I\nhope, and these ladies will oblige us.”"

    "text": "“I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.—Oh! my mother’s\nspectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! ‘Oh!’ said he, ‘I\ndo think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind\nexcessively.’—Which you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I must\nsay that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected,\nhe very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston,\nmost warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could.... ‘Oh!’\nsaid he, ‘I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort\nexcessively.’ I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought out\nthe baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so\nvery obliging as to take some, ‘Oh!’ said he directly, ‘there is\nnothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the\nfinest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.’ That, you\nknow, was so very.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no\ncompliment. Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis\ndoes them full justice—only we do not have them baked more than twice,\nand Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times—but\nMiss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it. The apples\nthemselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all\nfrom Donwell—some of Mr. Knightley’s most liberal supply. He sends us a\nsack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple\nanywhere as one of his trees—I believe there is two of them. My mother\nsays the orchard was always famous in her younger days. But I was\nreally quite shocked the other day—for Mr. Knightley called one\nmorning, and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them and\nsaid how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we were not got to\nthe end of our stock. ‘I am sure you must be,’ said he, ‘and I will\nsend you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever\nuse. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this\nyear. I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.’ So\nI begged he would not—for really as to ours being gone, I could not\nabsolutely say that we had a great many left—it was but half a dozen\nindeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at all\nbear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he had been\nalready; and Jane said the same. And when he was gone, she almost\nquarrelled with me—No, I should not say quarrelled, for we never had a\nquarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the\napples were so nearly gone; she wished I had made him believe we had a\ngreat many left. Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could.\nHowever, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large\nbasket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was\nvery much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said\nevery thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an old\nacquaintance! I am always glad to see him. But, however, I found\nafterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of\n_that_ sort his master had; he had brought them all—and now his master\nhad not one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to mind it\nhimself, he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for\nWilliam, you know, thinks more of his master’s profit than any thing;\nbut Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent\naway. She could not bear that her master should not be able to have\nanother apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid her not\nmind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for Mrs.\nHodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were\nsold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told me,\nand I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley\nknow any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I wanted\nto keep it from Jane’s knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it\nbefore I was aware.”"

But, on the other hand, she could\nnot admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be\nless disposed for employment than usual; she was still busy and\ncheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to have\nfaults; and farther, though thinking of him so much, and, as she sat\ndrawing or working, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress\nand close of their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and\ninventing elegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary\ndeclaration on his side was that she _refused_ _him_. Their affection\nwas always to subside into friendship. Every thing tender and charming\nwas to mark their parting; but still they were to part. When she became\nsensible of this, it struck her that she could not be very much in\nlove; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to\nquit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must\nproduce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings."

It was a long, well-written letter, giving\nthe particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the\naffection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, and\ndescribing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed\nattractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now of\napology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs.\nWeston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast\nbetween the places in some of the first blessings of social life was\njust enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much\nmore might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.—The\ncharm of her own name was not wanting. _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more\nthan once, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either\na compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and\nin the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by\nany such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect of\nher influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all\nconveyed. Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these\nwords—“I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss\nWoodhouse’s beautiful little friend. Pray make my excuses and adieus to\nher.” This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. Harriet was\nremembered only from being _her_ friend. His information and prospects\nas to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated;\nMrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own\nimagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again."

Her intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusal only grew\nmore interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent\nconsolation and happiness. His recollection of Harriet, and the words\nwhich clothed it, the “beautiful little friend,” suggested to her the\nidea of Harriet’s succeeding her in his affections. Was it\nimpossible?—No.—Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in\nunderstanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of\nher face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the\nprobabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.—For\nHarriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed."

Harriet\nlistened submissively, and said “it was very true—it was just as Miss\nWoodhouse described—it was not worth while to think about them—and she\nwould not think about them any longer” but no change of subject could\navail, and the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the\nEltons as before. At last Emma attacked her on another ground."

I perfectly understand your situation, however,\nMiss Woodhouse—(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father’s state of\nhealth must be a great drawback. Why does not he try Bath?—Indeed he\nshould. Let me recommend Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of\nits doing Mr. Woodhouse good.”"

You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play\ndelightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,\ncomfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got\ninto. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life\nto me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at\nMaple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I\nhonestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home,\nand expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be\ndisagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too—knowing what I had\nbeen accustomed to—of course he was not wholly without apprehension.\nWhen he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_\n_world_ I could give up—parties, balls, plays—for I had no fear of\nretirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was\nnot necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who\nhad no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me\nquite independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used\nto, I really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal\nto any sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed\nto every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages\nwere not necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments.\n‘But,’ said I, ‘to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without\nsomething of a musical society. I condition for nothing else; but\nwithout music, life would be a blank to me.’”"

I have no idea of that sort of\nthing. It is not likely that I _should_, considering what I have been\nused to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the\nother way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple\nGrove will probably be my model more than it ought to be—for we do not\nat all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.—However, my\nresolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.—I shall certainly have\nher very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall\nhave musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly\non the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very\nextensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her\nshortly.—I shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to my\nbrother and sister when they come to us. I am sure they will like her\nextremely; and when she gets a little acquainted with them, her fears\nwill completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners of\neither but what is highly conciliating.—I shall have her very often\nindeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a\nseat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.”"

Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strong—and her\ntemper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control;\nbut it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think, than\nshe used to be—And I love an open temper. No—till Cole alluded to my\nsupposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax\nand conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always—but with no\nthought beyond.”"

If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, she would\nrather stay at home.” It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had\nshe deemed it possible enough for wishing.

When he was here before, we made the best\nof it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there\nalways is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we\nintended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and I\ndo not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the\nsort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or\nto-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than\nhaving him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is the\nstate of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be\npleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generally\nthought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston’s\npartiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, most\ngratifying to me.

A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived\nat West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows.

Most comfortable carriage.—Oh! and I am sure our\nthanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most\nkindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.—But two such offers in\none day!—Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, ‘Upon my\nword, ma’am—.’ Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr.\nWoodhouse’s.

My dear Jane, are you\nsure you did not wet your feet?—It was but a drop or two, but I am so\nafraid:—but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely—and there was a mat to\nstep upon—I shall never forget his extreme politeness.—Oh! Mr. Frank\nChurchill, I must tell you my mother’s spectacles have never been in\nfault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of\nyour good-nature.

Quite wonderful how she does her\nhair!—No hairdresser from London I think could.—Ah! Dr. Hughes I\ndeclare—and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a\nmoment.—How do you do? How do you do?—Very well, I thank you. This is\ndelightful, is not it?—Where’s dear Mr. Richard?—Oh! there he is. Don’t\ndisturb him. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How do\nyou do, Mr. Richard?—I saw you the other day as you rode through the\ntown—Mrs. Otway, I protest!—and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss\nCaroline.—Such a host of friends!—and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!—How do\nyou do? How do you all do?—Quite well, I am much obliged to you. Never\nbetter.—Don’t I hear another carriage?—Who can this be?—very likely the\nworthy Coles.—Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about among\nsuch friends! And such a noble fire!—I am quite roasted. No coffee, I\nthank you, for me—never take coffee.—A little tea if you please, sir,\nby and bye,—no hurry—Oh! here it comes. Every thing so good!”"

Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,\nthough she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was\nalmost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly\nthe advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though\nshe had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by\nthe change. Mr. Weston might be his son’s superior.—In spite of this\nlittle rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see\nthe respectable length of the set as it was forming, and to feel that\nshe had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.—She was more\ndisturbed by Mr. Knightley’s not dancing than by any thing else.—There\nhe was, among the standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be\ndancing,—not classing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and\nwhist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance\ntill their rubbers were made up,—so young as he looked!—He could not\nhave appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had\nplaced himself. His tall, firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms\nand stooping shoulders of the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must\ndraw every body’s eyes; and, excepting her own partner, there was not\none among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.—He\nmoved a few steps nearer, and those few steps were enough to prove in\nhow gentlemanlike a manner, with what natural grace, he must have\ndanced, would he but take the trouble.—Whenever she caught his eye, she\nforced him to smile; but in general he was looking grave. She wished he\ncould love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.—He\nseemed often observing her. She must not flatter herself that he\nthought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she\ndid not feel afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and\nher partner. They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers.\nThat Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done, was\nindubitable."

Every body seemed\nhappy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom\nbestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in\nthe very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, very\nrecordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings\nusually are. There was one, however, which Emma thought something\nof.—The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no\npartner;—the only young lady sitting down;—and so equal had been\nhitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any one\ndisengaged was the wonder!—But Emma’s wonder lessened soon afterwards,\non seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to dance\nif it were possible to be avoided: she was sure he would not—and she\nwas expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room."

He came to the part of the room\nwhere the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in\nfront of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of\nmaintaining it. He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss\nSmith, or speaking to those who were close to her.—Emma saw it. She was\nnot yet dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had\ntherefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little\nshe saw it all. When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were\nexactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch;\nbut Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue\nwhich just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she\nperceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her, was\nnot only listening also, but even encouraging him by significant\nglances.—The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join\nhim and say, “Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?” to which his prompt reply\nwas, “Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.”"

Excellent dancing indeed!—Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I\nsaid I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody\nmissed me.—I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.\nGrandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a\nvast deal of chat, and backgammon.—Tea was made downstairs, biscuits\nand baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some of\nher throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were\namused, and who were your partners. ‘Oh!’ said I, ‘I shall not\nforestall Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love\nto tell you all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr.\nElton, I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.’\nMy dear sir, you are too obliging.—Is there nobody you would not\nrather?—I am not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane\non one arm, and me on the other!—Stop, stop, let us stand a little\nback, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she\nlooks!—Beautiful lace!—Now we all follow in her train. Quite the queen\nof the evening!—Well, here we are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take\ncare of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded\nthere were two. How very odd! I was convinced there were two, and there\nis but one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and\nstyle—Candles everywhere.—I was telling you of your grandmama,\nJane,—There was a little disappointment.—The baked apples and biscuits,\nexcellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of\nsweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr.\nWoodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all\nout again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread\nand asparagus—so she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would\nnot speak of it to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss\nWoodhouse, who would be so very much concerned!—Well, this is\nbrilliant! I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!—Such\nelegance and profusion!—I have seen nothing like it since—Well, where\nshall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere, so that Jane is not in a\ndraught. Where _I_ sit is of no consequence. Oh! do you recommend this\nside?—Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill—only it seems too good—but just as\nyou please. What you direct in this house cannot be wrong. Dear Jane,\nhow shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama? Soup too!\nBless me! I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent,\nand I cannot help beginning.”"

By a most fortunate chance his\nleaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance\nat this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning had induced\nhim to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road,\na mile or two beyond Highbury—and happening to have borrowed a pair of\nscissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to\nrestore them, he had been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a\nfew minutes: he was therefore later than he had intended; and being on\nfoot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. The\nterror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then\ntheir own portion. He had left them completely frightened; and Harriet\neagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength\nenough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits were quite overcome. It\nwas his idea to bring her to Hartfield: he had thought of no other\nplace."

This gallant young man, who seemed to love without\nfeeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed\nover the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate\ncivility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley’s excessive curiosity\nto know what this word might be, made him seize every possible moment\nfor darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it to\nbe _Dixon_. Jane Fairfax’s perception seemed to accompany his; her\ncomprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning, the\nsuperior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She was\nevidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed\nmore deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, “I did not\nknow that proper names were allowed,” pushed away the letters with even\nan angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word\nthat could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had made the\nattack, and turned towards her aunt."

Disputable, however,\nas might be the taste of such a termination, it was in itself a\ncharming walk, and the view which closed it extremely pretty.—The\nconsiderable slope, at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood,\ngradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half a\nmile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well\nclothed with wood;—and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed\nand sheltered, rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the\nriver making a close and handsome curve around it."

Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there.\nSeven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body\nhad a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount\nof the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of\nspirits, a want of union, which could not be got over. They separated\ntoo much into parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took\ncharge of Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank\nChurchill. And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise\nbetter. It seemed at first an accidental division, but it never\nmaterially varied. Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness\nto mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole\nhours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of\nseparation, between the other parties, too strong for any fine\nprospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to\nremove."

Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to\nher. To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he\ncared for—and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered,\nwas gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the\nadmission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most\nanimating period of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own\nestimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most people\nlooking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but\nflirtation could very well describe. “Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\nWoodhouse flirted together excessively.” They were laying themselves\nopen to that very phrase—and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple\nGrove by one lady, to Ireland by another. Not that Emma was gay and\nthoughtless from any real felicity; it was rather because she felt less\nhappy than she had expected. She laughed because she was disappointed;\nand though she liked him for his attentions, and thought them all,\nwhether in friendship, admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious,\nthey were not winning back her heart. She still intended him for her\nfriend."

She had not been able to speak; and,\non entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome—then\nreproaching herself for having taken no leave, making no\nacknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness, she looked out with\nvoice and hand eager to shew a difference; but it was just too late. He\nhad turned away, and the horses were in motion. She continued to look\nback, but in vain; and soon, with what appeared unusual speed, they\nwere half way down the hill, and every thing left far behind. She was\nvexed beyond what could have been expressed—almost beyond what she\ncould conceal. Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at\nany circumstance in her life. She was most forcibly struck. The truth\nof this representation there was no denying. She felt it at her heart.\nHow could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates! How could\nshe have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued! And\nhow suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude, of\nconcurrence, of common kindness!"

They, in their different homes, and their different ways,\nmight be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it was a\nmorning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational\nsatisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than\nany she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her\nfather, was felicity to it. _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure, for\nthere she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his\ncomfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his fond\naffection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her general conduct,\nbe open to any severe reproach. As a daughter, she hoped she was not\nwithout a heart. She hoped no one could have said to her, “How could\nyou be so unfeeling to your father?—I must, I will tell you truths\nwhile I can.” Miss Bates should never again—no, never! If attention, in\nfuture, could do away the past, she might hope to be forgiven. She had\nbeen often remiss, her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in\nthought than fact; scornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more.\nIn the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the very next\nmorning, and it should be the beginning, on her side, of a regular,\nequal, kindly intercourse."

She had scarcely\na stronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person, whom she\nhad been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she\nwould have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. She wanted\nto be of use to her; wanted to shew a value for her society, and\ntestify respect and consideration. She resolved to prevail on her to\nspend a day at Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation\nwas refused, and by a verbal message. “Miss Fairfax was not well enough\nto write;” and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it\nappeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited,\nthough against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering\nunder severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him\ndoubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge’s at the time\nproposed. Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged—appetite\nquite gone—and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms,\nnothing touching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing\napprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her. He thought\nshe had undertaken more than she was equal to, and that she felt it so\nherself, though she would not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Her\npresent home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous\ndisorder:—confined always to one room;—he could have wished it\notherwise—and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must\nacknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that\ndescription. Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were,\nin fact, only too great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived\nmore evil than good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern;\ngrieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some\nway of being useful. To take her—be it only an hour or two—from her\naunt, to give her change of air and scene, and quiet rational\nconversation, even for an hour or two, might do her good; and the\nfollowing morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling language\nshe could command, that she would call for her in the carriage at any\nhour that Jane would name—mentioning that she had Mr. Perry’s decided\nopinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient.

Frank Churchill had behaved\nvery ill by herself—very ill in many ways,—but it was not so much _his_\nbehaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him. It was the\nscrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet’s account, that gave the\ndeepest hue to his offence.—Poor Harriet! to be a second time the dupe\nof her misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken\nprophetically, when he once said, “Emma, you have been no friend to\nHarriet Smith.”—She was afraid she had done her nothing but\ndisservice.—It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this\ninstance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of\nthe mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise\nnever have entered Harriet’s imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged\nher admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever\ngiven her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty of\nhaving encouraged what she might have repressed. She might have\nprevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her influence\nwould have been enough. And now she was very conscious that she ought\nto have prevented them.—She felt that she had been risking her friend’s\nhappiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have\ndirected her to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to think\nof him, and that there were five hundred chances to one against his\never caring for her.—“But, with common sense,” she added, “I am afraid\nI have had little to do.”"

If she could not have been angry\nwith Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.—As for Jane\nFairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present\nsolicitude on her account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need no\nlonger be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health\nhaving, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.—Her\ndays of insignificance and evil were over.—She would soon be well, and\nhappy, and prosperous.—Emma could now imagine why her own attentions\nhad been slighted. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. No\ndoubt it had been from jealousy.—In Jane’s eyes she had been a rival;\nand well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be\nrepulsed. An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,\nand arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. She\nunderstood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from\nthe injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged that\nJane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her\ndesert. But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was\nlittle sympathy to be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful\nthat this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.\nConsidering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and\njudging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet’s mind, producing\nreserve and self-command, it would.—She must communicate the painful\ntruth, however, and as soon as possible. An injunction of secresy had\nbeen among Mr. Weston’s parting words. “For the present, the whole\naffair was to be completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a point of\nit, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost; and\nevery body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.”—Emma had\npromised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It was her superior duty."

From that evening, or at\nleast from the time of Miss Woodhouse’s encouraging her to think of\nhim, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more\nthan he had been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different\nmanner towards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness!—Latterly she\nhad been more and more aware of it. When they had been all walking\ntogether, he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very\ndelightfully!—He seemed to want to be acquainted with her. Emma knew it\nto have been very much the case. She had often observed the change, to\nalmost the same extent.—Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and\npraise from him—and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with\nwhat she had known of his opinion of Harriet. He praised her for being\nwithout art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous,\nfeelings.—She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had\ndwelt on them to her more than once.—Much that lived in Harriet’s\nmemory, many little particulars of the notice she had received from\nhim, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a\ncompliment implied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because\nunsuspected, by Emma. Circumstances that might swell to half an hour’s\nrelation, and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had\npassed undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest\noccurrences to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet,\nwere not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.—The first,\nwas his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at\nDonwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came, and he\nhad taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from the rest to\nhimself—and at first, he had talked to her in a more particular way\nthan he had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed!—(Harriet\ncould not recall it without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking\nher, whether her affections were engaged.—But as soon as she (Miss\nWoodhouse) appeared likely to join them, he changed the subject, and\nbegan talking about farming:—The second, was his having sat talking\nwith her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit, the\nvery last morning of his being at Hartfield—though, when he first came\nin, he had said that he could not stay five minutes—and his having told\nher, during their conversation, that though he must go to London, it\nwas very much against his inclination that he left home at all, which\nwas much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_. The\nsuperior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one article\nmarked, gave her severe pain."

    "text": "Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known\nhow much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,\nfirst in interest and affection.—Satisfied that it was so, and feeling\nit her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the\ndread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had\nbeen.—Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no\nfemale connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims\ncould be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far\nhe loved and esteemed Isabella. She had herself been first with him for\nmany years past. She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent\nor perverse, slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him,\ninsensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he\nwould not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own—but\nstill, from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of\nmind, he had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an\nendeavour to improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no\nother creature had at all shared. In spite of all her faults, she knew\nshe was dear to him; might she not say, very dear?—When the suggestions\nof hope, however, which must follow here, presented themselves, she\ncould not presume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think herself\nnot unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by\nMr. Knightley. _She_ could not. She could not flatter herself with any\nidea of blindness in his attachment to _her_. She had received a very\nrecent proof of its impartiality.—How shocked had he been by her\nbehaviour to Miss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he expressed\nhimself to her on the subject!—Not too strongly for the offence—but\nfar, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright\njustice and clear-sighted goodwill.—She had no hope, nothing to deserve\nthe name of hope, that he could have that sort of affection for herself\nwhich was now in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one,\nat times much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and\nbe overrating his regard for _her_.—Wish it she must, for his sake—be\nthe consequence nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his\nlife. Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at\nall, she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.—Let him but\ncontinue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr.\nKnightley to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of\ntheir precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace\nwould be fully secured.—Marriage, in fact, would not do for her. It\nwould be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what\nshe felt for him. Nothing should separate her from her father. She\nwould not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley."

The power of observation would be soon given—frightfully soon it\nappeared when her thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, she\nresolved against seeing Harriet.—It would do neither of them good, it\nwould do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther.—She was\nresolved not to be convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet had\nno authority for opposing Harriet’s confidence. To talk would be only\nto irritate.—She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to\nbeg that she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it\nto be her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of _one_\ntopic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were\nallowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of\nothers—she objected only to a tête-à-tête—they might be able to act as\nif they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.—Harriet submitted,\nand approved, and was grateful."

    "text": "A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her\nfriend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal\nof agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at\nall at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead,\nand to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and\nMr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement’s becoming known;\nas, considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid\nwithout leading to reports:—but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he\nwas extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her\nfamily, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it;\nor if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for “such things,”\nhe observed, “always got about.” Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston\nhad very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short—and very\ngreat had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. She had\nhardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn\nhow deeply she was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt\nsatisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her\ndaughter—who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a\ngratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly\nrespectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation;\nthought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of\nthemselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss\nFairfax’s recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to\ninvite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first, but,\non being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive, Mrs.\nWeston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her\nembarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject.\nApologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first\nreception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always\nfeeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the\ncause; but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good\ndeal of the present and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs.\nWeston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief\nto her companion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had so\nlong been, and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the\nsubject."

She bitterly regretted\nnot having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the\nenvious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.\nHad she followed Mr. Knightley’s known wishes, in paying that attention\nto Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know her\nbetter; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured to\nfind a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all\nprobability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her\nnow.—Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as\nan associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and the other—what\nwas she?—Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends;\nthat she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax’s confidence on this\nimportant matter—which was most probable—still, in knowing her as she\nought, and as she might, she must have been preserved from the\nabominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she\nhad not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so\nunpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a\nsubject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane’s feelings, by the\nlevity or carelessness of Frank Churchill’s. Of all the sources of evil\nsurrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she was persuaded\nthat she must herself have been the worst. She must have been a\nperpetual enemy. They never could have been all three together, without\nher having stabbed Jane Fairfax’s peace in a thousand instances; and on\nBox Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no\nmore."

She felt for\nHarriet, with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run\nmad, opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her\nbrain. She had led her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to her\nfor ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings, and as strong\nas it had ever been before, in reprobating any such alliance for him,\nas most unequal and degrading. Her way was clear, though not quite\nsmooth.—She spoke then, on being so entreated.—What did she say?—Just\nwhat she ought, of course. A lady always does.—She said enough to shew\nthere need not be despair—and to invite him to say more himself. He\n_had_ despaired at one period; he had received such an injunction to\ncaution and silence, as for the time crushed every hope;—she had begun\nby refusing to hear him.—The change had perhaps been somewhat\nsudden;—her proposal of taking another turn, her renewing the\nconversation which she had just put an end to, might be a little\nextraordinary!—She felt its inconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so\nobliging as to put up with it, and seek no farther explanation."

It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill\nthat had taken him from the country.—The Box Hill party had decided him\non going away. He would save himself from witnessing again such\npermitted, encouraged attentions.—He had gone to learn to be\nindifferent.—But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too much\ndomestic happiness in his brother’s house; woman wore too amiable a\nform in it; Isabella was too much like Emma—differing only in those\nstriking inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy\nbefore him, for much to have been done, even had his time been\nlonger.—He had stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day—till this\nvery morning’s post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.—Then,\nwith the gladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to\nfeel, having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving\nEmma, was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her,\nthat he could stay no longer. He had ridden home through the rain; and\nhad walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest and best\nof all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults, bore the\ndiscovery."

Her father—and Harriet. She could not be alone without feeling\nthe full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort\nof both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her father, it\nwas a question soon answered. She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley\nwould ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most\nsolemn resolution of never quitting her father.—She even wept over the\nidea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be only an\nengagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger\nof drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.—How\nto do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;—how to spare\nher from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement;\nhow to appear least her enemy?—On these subjects, her perplexity and\ndistress were very great—and her mind had to pass again and again\nthrough every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever\nsurrounded it.—She could only resolve at last, that she would still\navoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by\nletter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed\njust now for a time from Highbury, and—indulging in one scheme\nmore—nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation\nfor her to Brunswick Square.—Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;\nand a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.—She did\nnot think it in Harriet’s nature to escape being benefited by novelty\nand variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.—At any rate,\nit would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom\nevery thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the\nevil day, when they must all be together again."

    "text": "“If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected;\nbut expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and\nindulgence.—You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of\neven all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.—But\nI have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent. My courage\nrises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous to be\nhumble. I have already met with such success in two applications for\npardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours,\nand of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.—You\nmust all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when\nI first arrived at Randalls; you must consider me as having a secret\nwhich was to be kept at all hazards. This was the fact. My right to\nplace myself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another\nquestion. I shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to _think_ it\na right, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below,\nand casements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her openly; my\ndifficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to\nrequire definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we\nparted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in the\ncreation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.—Had she refused, I\nshould have gone mad.—But you will be ready to say, what was your hope\nin doing this?—What did you look forward to?—To any thing, every\nthing—to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts,\nperseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Every possibility of\ngood was before me, and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining\nher promises of faith and correspondence. If you need farther\nexplanation, I have the honour, my dear madam, of being your husband’s\nson, and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good,\nwhich no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value\nof.—See me, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit\nto Randalls;—and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might\nhave been sooner paid. You will look back and see that I did not come\ntill Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as _you_ were the person\nslighted, you will forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father’s\ncompassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from\nhis house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you. My behaviour,\nduring the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, I\nhope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point. And now I\ncome to the principal, the only important part of my conduct while\nbelonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or requires very\nsolicitous explanation. With the greatest respect, and the warmest\nfriendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I\nought to add, with the deepest humiliation.—A few words which dropped\nfrom him yesterday spoke his opinion, and some censure I acknowledge\nmyself liable to.—My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe,\nmore than it ought.—In order to assist a concealment so essential to\nme, I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of\nintimacy into which we were immediately thrown.—I cannot deny that Miss\nWoodhouse was my ostensible object—but I am sure you will believe the\ndeclaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference, I would\nnot have been induced by any selfish views to go on.—Amiable and\ndelightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me the idea of a young\nwoman likely to be attached; and that she was perfectly free from any\ntendency to being attached to me, was as much my conviction as my\nwish.—She received my attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured\nplayfulness, which exactly suited me. We seemed to understand each\nother. From our relative situation, those attentions were her due, and\nwere felt to be so.—Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand\nme before the expiration of that fortnight, I cannot say;—when I called\nto take leave of her, I remember that I was within a moment of\nconfessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not without suspicion;\nbut I have no doubt of her having since detected me, at least in some\ndegree.—She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must\nhave penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find, whenever the\nsubject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it did not take\nher wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it. I remember\nher telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her\nattentions to Miss Fairfax.—I hope this history of my conduct towards\nher will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what\nyou saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against Emma\nWoodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, and\nprocure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of\nthat said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly\naffection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as\nmyself.—Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,\nyou have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to\nget my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.\nIf you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.—Of\nthe pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that\nits being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F—, who would never\nhave allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.—The delicacy\nof her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam, is much\nbeyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly hope,\nknow her thoroughly yourself.—No description can describe her. She must\ntell you herself what she is—yet not by word, for never was there a\nhuman creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.—Since I\nbegan this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard\nfrom her.—She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never\ncomplains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion of her looks.\nI know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit.\nPerhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you without delay; I am\nimpatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how few minutes I was at\nRandalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and I am not much\nbetter yet; still insane either from happiness or misery. When I think\nof the kindness and favour I have met with, of her excellence and\npatience, and my uncle’s generosity, I am mad with joy: but when I\nrecollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little I deserve\nto be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her again!—But\nI must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me to\nencroach.—I must still add to this long letter. You have not heard all\nthat you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail\nyesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness\nwith which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the\nevent of the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me\nthe happiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early\nmeasures, but from the very particular circumstances, which left me not\nan hour to lose. I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty,\nand she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength\nand refinement.—But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she had\nentered into with that woman—Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to\nleave off abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.—I have been\nwalking over the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make\nthe rest of my letter what it ought to be.—It is, in fact, a most\nmortifying retrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can\nadmit, that my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were\nhighly blameable. _She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been\nenough.—My plea of concealing the truth she did not think\nsufficient.—She was displeased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought\nher, on a thousand occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I\nthought her even cold. But she was always right. If I had followed her\njudgment, and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed\nproper, I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever\nknown.—We quarrelled.— Do you remember the morning spent at\nDonwell?—_There_ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before\ncame to a crisis. I was late; I met her walking home by herself, and\nwanted to walk with her, but she would not suffer it. She absolutely\nrefused to allow me, which I then thought most unreasonable. Now,\nhowever, I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree\nof discretion. While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was\nbehaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman,\nwas she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made\nevery previous caution useless?—Had we been met walking together\nbetween Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.—I was\nmad enough, however, to resent.—I doubted her affection. I doubted it\nmore the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by such conduct on my\nside, such shameful, insolent neglect of her, and such apparent\ndevotion to Miss W., as it would have been impossible for any woman of\nsense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly\nintelligible to me.—In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless\non her side, abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to\nRichmond, though I might have staid with you till the next morning,\nmerely because I would be as angry with her as possible. Even then, I\nwas not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time; but I was\nthe injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went away determined\nthat she should make the first advances.—I shall always congratulate\nmyself that you were not of the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my\nbehaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well\nof me again. Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it\nproduced: as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls, she\nclosed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of\nwhose treatment of her, by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation\nand hatred. I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has\nbeen so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly\nprotest against the share of it which that woman has known.—‘Jane,’\nindeed!—You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling\nher by that name, even to you. Think, then, what I must have endured in\nhearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of\nneedless repetition, and all the insolence of imaginary superiority.\nHave patience with me, I shall soon have done.—She closed with this\noffer, resolving to break with me entirely, and wrote the next day to\ntell me that we never were to meet again.—_She_ _felt_ _the_\n_engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_\n_to_ _each_: _she_ _dissolved_ _it_.—This letter reached me on the very\nmorning of my poor aunt’s death. I answered it within an hour; but from\nthe confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business falling on\nme at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all the many other\nletters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk; and I, trusting\nthat I had written enough, though but a few lines, to satisfy her,\nremained without any uneasiness.—I was rather disappointed that I did\nnot hear from her again speedily; but I made excuses for her, and was\ntoo busy, and—may I add?—too cheerful in my views to be captious.—We\nremoved to Windsor; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from\nher, my own letters all returned!—and a few lines at the same time by\nthe post, stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest\nreply to her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could\nnot be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both to\nhave every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she\nnow sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested, that\nif I could not directly command hers, so as to send them to Highbury\nwithin a week, I would forward them after that period to her at—: in\nshort, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge’s, near Bristol, stared me\nin the face. I knew the name, the place, I knew all about it, and\ninstantly saw what she had been doing. It was perfectly accordant with\nthat resolution of character which I knew her to possess; and the\nsecrecy she had maintained, as to any such design in her former letter,\nwas equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy. For the world would\nnot she have seemed to threaten me.—Imagine the shock; imagine how,\ntill I had actually detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of\nthe post.—What was to be done?—One thing only.—I must speak to my\nuncle. Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.—I\nspoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened\naway his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated,\nwholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man! with\na deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness in the\nmarriage state as he had done.—I felt that it would be of a different\nsort.—Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in\nopening the cause to him, for my suspense while all was at stake?—No;\ndo not pity me till I reached Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her.\nDo not pity me till I saw her wan, sick looks.—I reached Highbury at\nthe time of day when, from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I\nwas certain of a good chance of finding her alone.—I was not\ndisappointed; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object\nof my journey. A great deal of very reasonable, very just displeasure I\nhad to persuade away. But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much\ndearer, than ever, and no moment’s uneasiness can ever occur between us\nagain. Now, my dear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude\nbefore. A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have\never shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will\ndictate towards her.—If you think me in a way to be happier than I\ndeserve, I am quite of your opinion.—Miss W. calls me the child of good\nfortune. I hope she is right.—In one respect, my good fortune is\nundoubted, that of being able to subscribe myself,"

Emma’s answer was ready at the first word.\n“While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be\nimpossible for her. She could never quit him.” Part only of this\nanswer, however, was admitted. The impossibility of her quitting her\nfather, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the\ninadmissibility of any other change, he could not agree to. He had been\nthinking it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to\ninduce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to\nbelieve it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not\nsuffer him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his\npersuasion, that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father’s\ncomfort, perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded. Mr.\nWoodhouse taken from Hartfield!—No, he felt that it ought not to be\nattempted. But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he\ntrusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;\nit was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as her\nfather’s happiness—in other words, his life—required Hartfield to\ncontinue her home, it should be his likewise."

Mrs. John Knightley was\ndelighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to\nher—and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was\nquite eager to have Harriet under her care.—When it was thus settled on\nher sister’s side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very\npersuadable.—Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a\nfortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse’s carriage.—It was\nall arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick\nSquare."

It was\na pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night; for, though the child\nseemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have been\nbetter if Perry had seen it.”"
