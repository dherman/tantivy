It was disposed of to a bookseller, it was even\nadvertised, and why the business proceeded no farther, the author has\nnever been able to learn. That any bookseller should think it\nworth-while to purchase what he did not think it worth-while to publish\nseems extraordinary. But with this, neither the author nor the public\nhave any other concern than as some observation is necessary upon those\nparts of the work which thirteen years have made comparatively\nobsolete. The public are entreated to bear in mind that thirteen years\nhave passed since it was finished, many more since it was begun, and\nthat during that period, places, manners, books, and opinions have\nundergone considerable changes."

    "text": "No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have\nsupposed her born to be an heroine. Her situation in life, the\ncharacter of her father and mother, her own person and disposition,\nwere all equally against her. Her father was a clergyman, without being\nneglected, or poor, and a very respectable man, though his name was\nRichard—and he had never been handsome. He had a considerable\nindependence besides two good livings—and he was not in the least\naddicted to locking up his daughters. Her mother was a woman of useful\nplain sense, with a good temper, and, what is more remarkable, with a\ngood constitution. She had three sons before Catherine was born; and\ninstead of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody\nmight expect, she still lived on—lived to have six children more—to see\nthem growing up around her, and to enjoy excellent health herself. A\nfamily of ten children will be always called a fine family, where there\nare heads and arms and legs enough for the number; but the Morlands had\nlittle other right to the word, for they were in general very plain,\nand Catherine, for many years of her life, as plain as any. She had a\nthin awkward figure, a sallow skin without colour, dark lank hair, and\nstrong features—so much for her person; and not less unpropitious for\nheroism seemed her mind. She was fond of all boys’ plays, and greatly\npreferred cricket not merely to dolls, but to the more heroic\nenjoyments of infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or\nwatering a rose-bush. Indeed she had no taste for a garden; and if she\ngathered flowers at all, it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief—at\nleast so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she\nwas forbidden to take. Such were her propensities—her abilities were\nquite as extraordinary. She never could learn or understand anything\nbefore she was taught; and sometimes not even then, for she was often\ninattentive, and occasionally stupid. Her mother was three months in\nteaching her only to repeat the “Beggar’s Petition”; and after all, her\nnext sister, Sally, could say it better than she did. Not that\nCatherine was always stupid—by no means; she learnt the fable of “The\nHare and Many Friends” as quickly as any girl in England. Her mother\nwished her to learn music; and Catherine was sure she should like it,\nfor she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet;\nso, at eight years old she began. She learnt a year, and could not bear\nit; and Mrs. Morland, who did not insist on her daughters being\naccomplished in spite of incapacity or distaste, allowed her to leave\noff. The day which dismissed the music-master was one of the happiest\nof Catherine’s life. Her taste for drawing was not superior; though\nwhenever she could obtain the outside of a letter from her mother or\nseize upon any other odd piece of paper, she did what she could in that\nway, by drawing houses and trees, hens and chickens, all very much like\none another. Writing and accounts she was taught by her father; French\nby her mother: her proficiency in either was not remarkable, and she\nshirked her lessons in both whenever she could. What a strange,\nunaccountable character!—for with all these symptoms of profligacy at\nten years old, she had neither a bad heart nor a bad temper, was seldom\nstubborn, scarcely ever quarrelsome, and very kind to the little ones,\nwith few interruptions of tyranny; she was moreover noisy and wild,\nhated confinement and cleanliness, and loved nothing so well in the\nworld as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house."

At fifteen, appearances were\nmending; she began to curl her hair and long for balls; her complexion\nimproved, her features were softened by plumpness and colour, her eyes\ngained more animation, and her figure more consequence. Her love of\ndirt gave way to an inclination for finery, and she grew clean as she\ngrew smart; she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father\nand mother remark on her personal improvement. “Catherine grows quite a\ngood-looking girl—she is almost pretty to-day,” were words which caught\nher ears now and then; and how welcome were the sounds! to look\n_almost_ pretty is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has\nbeen looking plain the first fifteen years of her life than a beauty\nfrom her cradle can ever receive."

But from fifteen to seventeen\nshe was in training for a heroine; she read all such works as heroines\nmust read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so\nserviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful\nlives."

Her greatest deficiency was in the pencil—she\nhad no notion of drawing—not enough even to attempt a sketch of her\nlover’s profile, that she might be detected in the design. There she\nfell miserably short of the true heroic height. At present she did not\nknow her own poverty, for she had no lover to portray. She had reached\nthe age of seventeen, without having seen one amiable youth who could\ncall forth her sensibility, without having inspired one real passion,\nand without having excited even any admiration but what was very\nmoderate and very transient. This was strange indeed! but strange\nthings may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched\nout. There was not one lord in the neighbourhood; no—not even a\nbaronet. There was not one family among their acquaintance who had\nreared and supported a boy accidentally found at their door—not one\nyoung man whose origin was unknown. Her father had no ward, and the\nsquire of the parish no children."

Cautions against\nthe violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young\nladies away to some remote farm-house, must, at such a moment, relieve\nthe fulness of her heart. Who would not think so? But Mrs. Morland knew\nso little of lords and baronets, that she entertained no notion of\ntheir general mischievousness, and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to\nher daughter from their machinations. Her cautions were confined to the\nfollowing points. “I beg, Catherine, you will always wrap yourself up\nvery warm about the throat, when you come from the Rooms at night; and\nI wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend; I\nwill give you this little book on purpose.”"

In one respect she was admirably fitted\nto introduce a young lady into public, being as fond of going\neverywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could be.\nDress was her passion. She had a most harmless delight in being fine;\nand our heroine’s entree into life could not take place till after\nthree or four days had been spent in learning what was mostly worn, and\nher chaperon was provided with a dress of the newest fashion.\nCatherine too made some purchases herself, and when all these matters\nwere arranged, the important evening came which was to usher her into\nthe Upper Rooms.

As for Mr. Allen, he repaired\ndirectly to the card-room, and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves.\nWith more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of\nher protégée, Mrs. Allen made her way through the throng of men by the\ndoor, as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow; Catherine,\nhowever, kept close at her side, and linked her arm too firmly within\nher friend’s to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling\nassembly. But to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along\nthe room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the\ncrowd; it seemed rather to increase as they went on, whereas she had\nimagined that when once fairly within the door, they should easily find\nseats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convenience. But\nthis was far from being the case, and though by unwearied diligence\nthey gained even the top of the room, their situation was just the\nsame; they saw nothing of the dancers but the high feathers of some of\nthe ladies. Still they moved on—something better was yet in view; and\nby a continued exertion of strength and ingenuity they found themselves\nat last in the passage behind the highest bench. Here there was\nsomething less of crowd than below; and hence Miss Morland had a\ncomprehensive view of all the company beneath her, and of all the\ndangers of her late passage through them. It was a splendid sight, and\nshe began, for the first time that evening, to feel herself at a ball:\nshe longed to dance, but she had not an acquaintance in the room. Mrs.\nAllen did all that she could do in such a case by saying very placidly,\nevery now and then, “I wish you could dance, my dear—I wish you could\nget a partner.” For some time her young friend felt obliged to her for\nthese wishes; but they were repeated so often, and proved so totally\nineffectual, that Catherine grew tired at last, and would thank her no\nmore."

His address was good, and\nCatherine felt herself in high luck. There was little leisure for\nspeaking while they danced; but when they were seated at tea, she found\nhim as agreeable as she had already given him credit for being. He\ntalked with fluency and spirit—and there was an archness and pleasantry\nin his manner which interested, though it was hardly understood by her.\nAfter chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the\nobjects around them, he suddenly addressed her with—“I have hitherto\nbeen very remiss, madam, in the proper attentions of a partner here; I\nhave not yet asked you how long you have been in Bath; whether you were\never here before; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms, the\ntheatre, and the concert; and how you like the place altogether. I have\nbeen very negligent—but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these\nparticulars? If you are I will begin directly.”"

Their\njoy on this meeting was very great, as well it might, since they had\nbeen contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen\nyears. Compliments on good looks now passed; and, after observing how\ntime had slipped away since they were last together, how little they\nhad thought of meeting in Bath, and what a pleasure it was to see an\nold friend, they proceeded to make inquiries and give intelligence as\nto their families, sisters, and cousins, talking both together, far\nmore ready to give than to receive information, and each hearing very\nlittle of what the other said. Mrs. Thorpe, however, had one great\nadvantage as a talker, over Mrs. Allen, in a family of children; and\nwhen she expatiated on the talents of her sons, and the beauty of her\ndaughters, when she related their different situations and views—that\nJohn was at Oxford, Edward at Merchant Taylors’, and William at sea—and\nall of them more beloved and respected in their different station than\nany other three beings ever were, Mrs. Allen had no similar information\nto give, no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving\near of her friend, and was forced to sit and appear to listen to all\nthese maternal effusions, consoling herself, however, with the\ndiscovery, which her keen eyes soon made, that the lace on Mrs. Thorpe’s\npelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own."

Miss Thorpe, however, being four years older than Miss\nMorland, and at least four years better informed, had a very decided\nadvantage in discussing such points; she could compare the balls of\nBath with those of Tunbridge, its fashions with the fashions of London;\ncould rectify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of\ntasteful attire; could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and\nlady who only smiled on each other; and point out a quiz through the\nthickness of a crowd. These powers received due admiration from\nCatherine, to whom they were entirely new; and the respect which they\nnaturally inspired might have been too great for familiarity, had not\nthe easy gaiety of Miss Thorpe’s manners, and her frequent expressions\nof delight on this acquaintance with her, softened down every feeling\nof awe, and left nothing but tender affection. Their increasing\nattachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the\npump-room, but required, when they all quitted it together, that Miss\nThorpe should accompany Miss Morland to the very door of Mr. Allen’s\nhouse; and that they should there part with a most affectionate and\nlengthened shake of hands, after learning, to their mutual relief, that\nthey should see each other across the theatre at night, and say their\nprayers in the same chapel the next morning. Catherine then ran\ndirectly upstairs, and watched Miss Thorpe’s progress down the street\nfrom the drawing-room window; admired the graceful spirit of her walk,\nthe fashionable air of her figure and dress; and felt grateful, as well\nshe might, for the chance which had procured her such a friend."

Here Catherine and Isabella, arm in\narm, again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved\nconversation; they talked much, and with much enjoyment; but again was\nCatherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner. He was\nnowhere to be met with; every search for him was equally unsuccessful,\nin morning lounges or evening assemblies; neither at the Upper nor\nLower Rooms, at dressed or undressed balls, was he perceivable; nor\namong the walkers, the horsemen, or the curricle-drivers of the\nmorning. His name was not in the pump-room book, and curiosity could do\nno more. He must be gone from Bath. Yet he had not mentioned that his\nstay would be so short! this sort of mysteriousness, which is always so\nbecoming in a hero, threw a fresh grace in Catherine’s imagination\naround his person and manners, and increased her anxiety to know more\nof him. From the Thorpes she could learn nothing, for they had been\nonly two days in Bath before they met with Mrs. Allen. It was a\nsubject, however, in which she often indulged with her fair friend,\nfrom whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to\nthink of him; and his impression on her fancy was not suffered\ntherefore to weaken. Isabella was very sure that he must be a charming\nyoung man, and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with\nher dear Catherine, and would therefore shortly return. She liked him\nthe better for being a clergyman, “for she must confess herself very\npartial to the profession”; and something like a sigh escaped her as\nshe said it. Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of\nthat gentle emotion—but she was not experienced enough in the finesse\nof love, or the duties of friendship, to know when delicate raillery\nwas properly called for, or when a confidence should be forced."

    "text": "The progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick\nas its beginning had been warm, and they passed so rapidly through\nevery gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no\nfresh proof of it to be given to their friends or themselves. They\ncalled each other by their Christian name, were always arm in arm when\nthey walked, pinned up each other’s train for the dance, and were not\nto be divided in the set; and if a rainy morning deprived them of other\nenjoyments, they were still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and\ndirt, and shut themselves up, to read novels together. Yes, novels; for\nI will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with\nnovel-writers, of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very\nperformances, to the number of which they are themselves adding—joining\nwith their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such\nworks, and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own\nheroine, who, if she accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over\nits insipid pages with disgust. Alas! if the heroine of one novel be\nnot patronized by the heroine of another, from whom can she expect\nprotection and regard? I cannot approve of it. Let us leave it to the\nreviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure, and over\nevery new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which\nthe press now groans. Let us not desert one another; we are an injured\nbody. Although our productions have afforded more extensive and\nunaffected pleasure than those of any other literary corporation in the\nworld, no species of composition has been so much decried. From pride,\nignorance, or fashion, our foes are almost as many as our readers. And\nwhile the abilities of the nine-hundredth abridger of the History of\nEngland, or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume some\ndozen lines of Milton, Pope, and Prior, with a paper from the\nSpectator, and a chapter from Sterne, are eulogized by a thousand\npens—there seems almost a general wish of decrying the capacity and\nundervaluing the labour of the novelist, and of slighting the\nperformances which have only genius, wit, and taste to recommend them.\n“I am no novel-reader—I seldom look into novels—Do not imagine that _I_\noften read novels—It is really very well for a novel.” Such is the\ncommon cant. “And what are you reading, Miss——?” “Oh! it is only a\nnovel!” replies the young lady, while she lays down her book with\naffected indifference, or momentary shame. “It is only Cecilia, or\nCamilla, or Belinda”; or, in short, only some work in which the\ngreatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough\nknowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties,\nthe liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in\nthe best-chosen language. Now, had the same young lady been engaged\nwith a volume of the Spectator, instead of such a work, how proudly\nwould she have produced the book, and told its name; though the chances\nmust be against her being occupied by any part of that voluminous\npublication, of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a\nyoung person of taste: the substance of its papers so often consisting\nin the statement of improbable circumstances, unnatural characters, and\ntopics of conversation which no longer concern anyone living; and their\nlanguage, too, frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea\nof the age that could endure it."

He took out his watch: “How long do you think we\nhave been running it from Tetbury, Miss Morland?”"

A pre-engagement in Edgar’s Buildings prevented his accepting\nthe invitation of one friend, and obliged him to hurry away as soon as\nhe had satisfied the demands of the other. The time of the two parties\nuniting in the Octagon Room being correctly adjusted, Catherine was\nthen left to the luxury of a raised, restless, and frightened\nimagination over the pages of Udolpho, lost from all worldly concerns\nof dressing and dinner, incapable of soothing Mrs. Allen’s fears on the\ndelay of an expected dressmaker, and having only one minute in sixty to\nbestow even on the reflection of her own felicity, in being already\nengaged for the evening."

The younger Miss Thorpes being also dancing, Catherine was\nleft to the mercy of Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs. Allen, between whom she now\nremained. She could not help being vexed at the non-appearance of Mr.\nThorpe, for she not only longed to be dancing, but was likewise aware\nthat, as the real dignity of her situation could not be known, she was\nsharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all\nthe discredit of wanting a partner. To be disgraced in the eye of the\nworld, to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity,\nher actions all innocence, and the misconduct of another the true\nsource of her debasement, is one of those circumstances which\npeculiarly belong to the heroine’s life, and her fortitude under it\nwhat particularly dignifies her character. Catherine had fortitude too;\nshe suffered, but no murmur passed her lips."

He looked as handsome and\nas lively as ever, and was talking with interest to a fashionable and\npleasing-looking young woman, who leant on his arm, and whom Catherine\nimmediately guessed to be his sister; thus unthinkingly throwing away a\nfair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever, by being\nmarried already. But guided only by what was simple and probable, it\nhad never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married; he had not\nbehaved, he had not talked, like the married men to whom she had been\nused; he had never mentioned a wife, and he had acknowledged a sister.\nFrom these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister’s\nnow being by his side; and therefore, instead of turning of a deathlike\npaleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen’s bosom, Catherine sat\nerect, in the perfect use of her senses, and with cheeks only a little\nredder than usual."

This was\naccordingly done, Mr. Tilney still continuing standing before them; and\nafter a few minutes’ consideration, he asked Catherine to dance with\nhim. This compliment, delightful as it was, produced severe\nmortification to the lady; and in giving her denial, she expressed her\nsorrow on the occasion so very much as if she really felt it, that had\nThorpe, who joined her just afterwards, been half a minute earlier, he\nmight have thought her sufferings rather too acute. The very easy\nmanner in which he then told her that he had kept her waiting did not\nby any means reconcile her more to her lot; nor did the particulars\nwhich he entered into while they were standing up, of the horses and\ndogs of the friend whom he had just left, and of a proposed exchange of\nterriers between them, interest her so much as to prevent her looking\nvery often towards that part of the room where she had left Mr. Tilney.\nOf her dear Isabella, to whom she particularly longed to point out that\ngentleman, she could see nothing. They were in different sets. She was\nseparated from all her party, and away from all her acquaintance; one\nmortification succeeded another, and from the whole she deduced this\nuseful lesson, that to go previously engaged to a ball does not\nnecessarily increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady.\nFrom such a moralizing strain as this, she was suddenly roused by a\ntouch on the shoulder, and turning round, perceived Mrs. Hughes\ndirectly behind her, attended by Miss Tilney and a gentleman. “I beg\nyour pardon, Miss Morland,” said she, “for this liberty—but I cannot\nanyhow get to Miss Thorpe, and Mrs. Thorpe said she was sure you would\nnot have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you.”\nMrs. Hughes could not have applied to any creature in the room more\nhappy to oblige her than Catherine. The young ladies were introduced to\neach other, Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of such goodness,\nMiss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of\nthe obligation; and Mrs. Hughes, satisfied with having so respectably\nsettled her young charge, returned to her party."

Catherine, interested at\nonce by her appearance and her relationship to Mr. Tilney, was desirous\nof being acquainted with her, and readily talked therefore whenever she\ncould think of anything to say, and had courage and leisure for saying\nit. But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy, by\nthe frequent want of one or more of these requisites, prevented their\ndoing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance,\nby informing themselves how well the other liked Bath, how much she\nadmired its buildings and surrounding country, whether she drew, or\nplayed, or sang, and whether she was fond of riding on horseback."

    "text": "The progress of Catherine’s unhappiness from the events of the evening\nwas as follows. It appeared first in a general dissatisfaction with\neverybody about her, while she remained in the rooms, which speedily\nbrought on considerable weariness and a violent desire to go home.\nThis, on arriving in Pulteney Street, took the direction of\nextraordinary hunger, and when that was appeased, changed into an\nearnest longing to be in bed; such was the extreme point of her\ndistress; for when there she immediately fell into a sound sleep which\nlasted nine hours, and from which she awoke perfectly revived, in\nexcellent spirits, with fresh hopes and fresh schemes. The first wish\nof her heart was to improve her acquaintance with Miss Tilney, and\nalmost her first resolution, to seek her for that purpose, in the\npump-room at noon. In the pump-room, one so newly arrived in Bath must\nbe met with, and that building she had already found so favourable for\nthe discovery of female excellence, and the completion of female\nintimacy, so admirably adapted for secret discourses and unlimited\nconfidence, that she was most reasonably encouraged to expect another\nfriend from within its walls. Her plan for the morning thus settled,\nshe sat quietly down to her book after breakfast, resolving to remain\nin the same place and the same employment till the clock struck one;\nand from habitude very little incommoded by the remarks and\nejaculations of Mrs. Allen, whose vacancy of mind and incapacity for\nthinking were such, that as she never talked a great deal, so she could\nnever be entirely silent; and, therefore, while she sat at her work, if\nshe lost her needle or broke her thread, if she heard a carriage in the\nstreet, or saw a speck upon her gown, she must observe it aloud,\nwhether there were anyone at leisure to answer her or not. At about\nhalf past twelve, a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the\nwindow, and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there being\ntwo open carriages at the door, in the first only a servant, her\nbrother driving Miss Thorpe in the second, before John Thorpe came\nrunning upstairs, calling out, “Well, Miss Morland, here I am. Have you\nbeen waiting long? We could not come before; the old devil of a\ncoachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into,\nand now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out\nof the street. How do you do, Mrs. Allen? A famous ball last night, was\nnot it? Come, Miss Morland, be quick, for the others are in a\nconfounded hurry to be off. They want to get their tumble over.”"

Everything being then arranged, the servant who stood at the\nhorse’s head was bid in an important voice “to let him go,” and off\nthey went in the quietest manner imaginable, without a plunge or a\ncaper, or anything like one. Catherine, delighted at so happy an\nescape, spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful surprise; and her\ncompanion immediately made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her\nthat it was entirely owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which\nhe had then held the reins, and the singular discernment and dexterity\nwith which he had directed his whip. Catherine, though she could not\nhelp wondering that with such perfect command of his horse, he should\nthink it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks,\ncongratulated herself sincerely on being under the care of so excellent\na coachman; and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the\nsame quiet manner, without showing the smallest propensity towards any\nunpleasant vivacity, and (considering its inevitable pace was ten miles\nan hour) by no means alarmingly fast, gave herself up to all the\nenjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind, in a fine\nmild day of February, with the consciousness of safety. A silence of\nseveral minutes succeeded their first short dialogue; it was broken by\nThorpe’s saying very abruptly, “Old Allen is as rich as a Jew—is not\nhe?” Catherine did not understand him—and he repeated his question,\nadding in explanation, “Old Allen, the man you are with.”"

    "text": "Catherine listened with astonishment; she knew not how to reconcile two\nsuch very different accounts of the same thing; for she had not been\nbrought up to understand the propensities of a rattle, nor to know to\nhow many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity\nwill lead. Her own family were plain, matter-of-fact people who seldom\naimed at wit of any kind; her father, at the utmost, being contented\nwith a pun, and her mother with a proverb; they were not in the habit\ntherefore of telling lies to increase their importance, or of asserting\nat one moment what they would contradict the next. She reflected on the\naffair for some time in much perplexity, and was more than once on the\npoint of requesting from Mr. Thorpe a clearer insight into his real\nopinion on the subject; but she checked herself, because it appeared to\nher that he did not excel in giving those clearer insights, in making\nthose things plain which he had before made ambiguous; and, joining to\nthis, the consideration that he would not really suffer his sister and\nhis friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily\npreserve them, she concluded at last that he must know the carriage to\nbe in fact perfectly safe, and therefore would alarm herself no longer.\nBy him the whole matter seemed entirely forgotten; and all the rest of\nhis conversation, or rather talk, began and ended with himself and his\nown concerns. He told her of horses which he had bought for a trifle\nand sold for incredible sums; of racing matches, in which his judgment\nhad infallibly foretold the winner; of shooting parties, in which he\nhad killed more birds (though without having one good shot) than all\nhis companions together; and described to her some famous day’s sport,\nwith the fox-hounds, in which his foresight and skill in directing the\ndogs had repaired the mistakes of the most experienced huntsman, and in\nwhich the boldness of his riding, though it had never endangered his\nown life for a moment, had been constantly leading others into\ndifficulties, which he calmly concluded had broken the necks of many."

It was a\nbold surmise, for he was Isabella’s brother; and she had been assured\nby James that his manners would recommend him to all her sex; but in\nspite of this, the extreme weariness of his company, which crept over\nher before they had been out an hour, and which continued unceasingly\nto increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again, induced her, in\nsome small degree, to resist such high authority, and to distrust his\npowers of giving universal pleasure."

Her own feelings\nentirely engrossed her; her wretchedness was most acute on finding\nherself obliged to go directly home. It was ages since she had had a\nmoment’s conversation with her dearest Catherine; and, though she had\nsuch thousands of things to say to her, it appeared as if they were\nnever to be together again; so, with smiles of most exquisite misery,\nand the laughing eye of utter despondency, she bade her friend adieu\nand went on."

But nothing of that kind occurred, no visitors appeared to\ndelay them, and they all three set off in good time for the pump-room,\nwhere the ordinary course of events and conversation took place; Mr.\nAllen, after drinking his glass of water, joined some gentlemen to talk\nover the politics of the day and compare the accounts of their\nnewspapers; and the ladies walked about together, noticing every new\nface, and almost every new bonnet in the room. The female part of the\nThorpe family, attended by James Morland, appeared among the crowd in\nless than a quarter of an hour, and Catherine immediately took her\nusual place by the side of her friend. James, who was now in constant\nattendance, maintained a similar position, and separating themselves\nfrom the rest of their party, they walked in that manner for some time,\ntill Catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which,\nconfining her entirely to her friend and brother, gave her very little\nshare in the notice of either. They were always engaged in some\nsentimental discussion or lively dispute, but their sentiment was\nconveyed in such whispering voices, and their vivacity attended with so\nmuch laughter, that though Catherine’s supporting opinion was not\nunfrequently called for by one or the other, she was never able to give\nany, from not having heard a word of the subject. At length however she\nwas empowered to disengage herself from her friend, by the avowed\nnecessity of speaking to Miss Tilney, whom she most joyfully saw just\nentering the room with Mrs. Hughes, and whom she instantly joined, with\na firmer determination to be acquainted, than she might have had\ncourage to command, had she not been urged by the disappointment of the\nday before. Miss Tilney met her with great civility, returned her\nadvances with equal goodwill, and they continued talking together as\nlong as both parties remained in the room; and though in all\nprobability not an observation was made, nor an expression used by\neither which had not been made and used some thousands of times before,\nunder that roof, in every Bath season, yet the merit of their being\nspoken with simplicity and truth, and without personal conceit, might\nbe something uncommon."

    "text": "She went home very happy. The morning had answered all her hopes, and\nthe evening of the following day was now the object of expectation, the\nfuture good. What gown and what head-dress she should wear on the\noccasion became her chief concern. She cannot be justified in it. Dress\nis at all times a frivolous distinction, and excessive solicitude about\nit often destroys its own aim. Catherine knew all this very well; her\ngreat aunt had read her a lecture on the subject only the Christmas\nbefore; and yet she lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday night debating\nbetween her spotted and her tamboured muslin, and nothing but the\nshortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening.\nThis would have been an error in judgment, great though not uncommon,\nfrom which one of the other sex rather than her own, a brother rather\nthan a great aunt, might have warned her, for man only can be aware of\nthe insensibility of man towards a new gown. It would be mortifying to\nthe feelings of many ladies, could they be made to understand how\nlittle the heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their\nattire; how little it is biased by the texture of their muslin, and how\nunsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted, the sprigged,\nthe mull, or the jackonet. Woman is fine for her own satisfaction\nalone. No man will admire her the more, no woman will like her the\nbetter for it. Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a\nsomething of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the\nlatter. But not one of these grave reflections troubled the\ntranquillity of Catherine."

She had then been\nexulting in her engagement to Thorpe, and was now chiefly anxious to\navoid his sight, lest he should engage her again; for though she could\nnot, dared not expect that Mr. Tilney should ask her a third time to\ndance, her wishes, hopes, and plans all centred in nothing less. Every\nyoung lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment, for every\nyoung lady has at some time or other known the same agitation. All have\nbeen, or at least all have believed themselves to be, in danger from\nthe pursuit of someone whom they wished to avoid; and all have been\nanxious for the attentions of someone whom they wished to please. As\nsoon as they were joined by the Thorpes, Catherine’s agony began; she\nfidgeted about if John Thorpe came towards her, hid herself as much as\npossible from his view, and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear\nhim. The cotillions were over, the country-dancing beginning, and she\nsaw nothing of the Tilneys."

With what sparkling eyes and ready motion she\ngranted his request, and with how pleasing a flutter of heart she went\nwith him to the set, may be easily imagined. To escape, and, as she\nbelieved, so narrowly escape John Thorpe, and to be asked, so\nimmediately on his joining her, asked by Mr. Tilney, as if he had\nsought her on purpose!—it did not appear to her that life could supply\nany greater felicity."

He was a very handsome man,\nof a commanding aspect, past the bloom, but not past the vigour of\nlife; and with his eye still directed towards her, she saw him\npresently address Mr. Tilney in a familiar whisper. Confused by his\nnotice, and blushing from the fear of its being excited by something\nwrong in her appearance, she turned away her head. But while she did\nso, the gentleman retreated, and her partner, coming nearer, said, “I\nsee that you guess what I have just been asked. That gentleman knows\nyour name, and you have a right to know his. It is General Tilney, my\nfather.”"

    "text": "In chatting with Miss Tilney before the evening concluded, a new source\nof felicity arose to her. She had never taken a country walk since her\narrival in Bath. Miss Tilney, to whom all the commonly frequented\nenvirons were familiar, spoke of them in terms which made her all\neagerness to know them too; and on her openly fearing that she might\nfind nobody to go with her, it was proposed by the brother and sister\nthat they should join in a walk, some morning or other. “I shall like\nit,” she cried, “beyond anything in the world; and do not let us put it\noff—let us go to-morrow.” This was readily agreed to, with only a\nproviso of Miss Tilney’s, that it did not rain, which Catherine was\nsure it would not. At twelve o’clock, they were to call for her in\nPulteney Street; and “Remember—twelve o’clock,” was her parting speech\nto her new friend. Of her other, her older, her more established\nfriend, Isabella, of whose fidelity and worth she had enjoyed a\nfortnight’s experience, she scarcely saw anything during the evening.\nYet, though longing to make her acquainted with her happiness, she\ncheerfully submitted to the wish of Mr. Allen, which took them rather\nearly away, and her spirits danced within her, as she danced in her\nchair all the way home."

She applied to Mr. Allen for\nconfirmation of her hopes, but Mr. Allen, not having his own skies and\nbarometer about him, declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine.\nShe applied to Mrs. Allen, and Mrs. Allen’s opinion was more positive.\n“She had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day, if the\nclouds would only go off, and the sun keep out.”"

She could not think the Tilneys had\nacted quite well by her, in so readily giving up their engagement,\nwithout sending her any message of excuse. It was now but an hour later\nthan the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk; and, in spite\nof what she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the\ncourse of that hour, she could not from her own observation help\nthinking that they might have gone with very little inconvenience. To\nfeel herself slighted by them was very painful. On the other hand, the\ndelight of exploring an edifice like Udolpho, as her fancy represented\nBlaize Castle to be, was such a counterpoise of good as might console\nher for almost anything."

She saw them both looking back at\nher. “Stop, stop, Mr. Thorpe,” she impatiently cried; “it is Miss\nTilney; it is indeed. How could you tell me they were gone? Stop, stop,\nI will get out this moment and go to them.” But to what purpose did she\nspeak? Thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot; the Tilneys,\nwho had soon ceased to look after her, were in a moment out of sight\nround the corner of Laura Place, and in another moment she was herself\nwhisked into the marketplace. Still, however, and during the length of\nanother street, she entreated him to stop. “Pray, pray stop, Mr.\nThorpe. I cannot go on. I will not go on. I must go back to Miss\nTilney.” But Mr. Thorpe only laughed, smacked his whip, encouraged his\nhorse, made odd noises, and drove on; and Catherine, angry and vexed as\nshe was, having no power of getting away, was obliged to give up the\npoint and submit. Her reproaches, however, were not spared. “How could\nyou deceive me so, Mr. Thorpe? How could you say that you saw them\ndriving up the Lansdown Road? I would not have had it happen so for the\nworld. They must think it so strange, so rude of me! to go by them,\ntoo, without saying a word! you do not know how vexed I am; I shall\nhave no pleasure at Clifton, nor in anything else. I had rather, ten\nthousand times rather, get out now, and walk back to them. How could\nyou say you saw them driving out in a phaeton?” Thorpe defended himself\nvery stoutly, declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his\nlife, and would hardly give up the point of its having been Tilney\nhimself."

She listened reluctantly, and her replies were\nshort. Blaize Castle remained her only comfort; towards _that_, she\nstill looked at intervals with pleasure; though rather than be\ndisappointed of the promised walk, and especially rather than be\nthought ill of by the Tilneys, she would willingly have given up all\nthe happiness which its walls could supply—the happiness of a progress\nthrough a long suite of lofty rooms, exhibiting the remains of\nmagnificent furniture, though now for many years deserted—the happiness\nof being stopped in their way along narrow, winding vaults, by a low,\ngrated door; or even of having their lamp, their only lamp,\nextinguished by a sudden gust of wind, and of being left in total\ndarkness. In the meanwhile, they proceeded on their journey without any\nmischance, and were within view of the town of Keynsham, when a halloo\nfrom Morland, who was behind them, made his friend pull up, to know\nwhat was the matter. The others then came close enough for\nconversation, and Morland said, “We had better go back, Thorpe; it is\ntoo late to go on to-day; your sister thinks so as well as I. We have\nbeen exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street, very little more than\nseven miles; and, I suppose, we have at least eight more to go. It will\nnever do. We set out a great deal too late. We had much better put it\noff till another day, and turn round.”"

To Milsom Street she\nwas directed, and having made herself perfect in the number, hastened\naway with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit, explain her\nconduct, and be forgiven; tripping lightly through the church-yard, and\nresolutely turning away her eyes, that she might not be obliged to see\nher beloved Isabella and her dear family, who, she had reason to\nbelieve, were in a shop hard by. She reached the house without any\nimpediment, looked at the number, knocked at the door, and inquired for\nMiss Tilney. The man believed Miss Tilney to be at home, but was not\nquite certain. Would she be pleased to send up her name? She gave her\ncard. In a few minutes the servant returned, and with a look which did\nnot quite confirm his words, said he had been mistaken, for that Miss\nTilney was walked out. Catherine, with a blush of mortification, left\nthe house. She felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney _was_ at home,\nand too much offended to admit her; and as she retired down the street,\ncould not withhold one glance at the drawing-room windows, in\nexpectation of seeing her there, but no one appeared at them. At the\nbottom of the street, however, she looked back again, and then, not at\na window, but issuing from the door, she saw Miss Tilney herself. She\nwas followed by a gentleman, whom Catherine believed to be her father,\nand they turned up towards Edgar’s Buildings. Catherine, in deep\nmortification, proceeded on her way. She could almost be angry herself\nat such angry incivility; but she checked the resentful sensation; she\nremembered her own ignorance. She knew not how such an offence as hers\nmight be classed by the laws of worldly politeness, to what a degree of\nunforgivingness it might with propriety lead, nor to what rigours of\nrudeness in return it might justly make her amenable."

To the theatre\naccordingly they all went; no Tilneys appeared to plague or please her;\nshe feared that, amongst the many perfections of the family, a fondness\nfor plays was not to be ranked; but perhaps it was because they were\nhabituated to the finer performances of the London stage, which she\nknew, on Isabella’s authority, rendered everything else of the kind\n“quite horrid.” She was not deceived in her own expectation of\npleasure; the comedy so well suspended her care that no one, observing\nher during the first four acts, would have supposed she had any\nwretchedness about her. On the beginning of the fifth, however, the\nsudden view of Mr. Henry Tilney and his father, joining a party in the\nopposite box, recalled her to anxiety and distress. The stage could no\nlonger excite genuine merriment—no longer keep her whole attention.\nEvery other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box;\nand, for the space of two entire scenes, did she thus watch Henry\nTilney, without being once able to catch his eye. No longer could he be\nsuspected of indifference for a play; his notice was never withdrawn\nfrom the stage during two whole scenes. At length, however, he did look\ntowards her, and he bowed—but such a bow! no smile, no continued\nobservance attended it; his eyes were immediately returned to their\nformer direction. Catherine was restlessly miserable; she could almost\nhave run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her\nexplanation. Feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her; instead\nof considering her own dignity injured by this ready\ncondemnation—instead of proudly resolving, in conscious innocence, to\nshow her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it, to\nleave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation, and to\nenlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight, or flirting with\nsomebody else—she took to herself all the shame of misconduct, or at\nleast of its appearance, and was only eager for an opportunity of\nexplaining its cause."

The Clifton scheme had been deferred, not relinquished, and on\nthe afternoon’s Crescent of this day, it was brought forward again. In\na private consultation between Isabella and James, the former of whom\nhad particularly set her heart upon going, and the latter no less\nanxiously placed his upon pleasing her, it was agreed that, provided\nthe weather were fair, the party should take place on the following\nmorning; and they were to set off very early, in order to be at home in\ngood time. The affair thus determined, and Thorpe’s approbation\nsecured, Catherine only remained to be apprised of it. She had left\nthem for a few minutes to speak to Miss Tilney. In that interval the\nplan was completed, and as soon as she came again, her agreement was\ndemanded; but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by Isabella,\nCatherine looked grave, was very sorry, but could not go. The\nengagement which ought to have kept her from joining in the former\nattempt would make it impossible for her to accompany them now. She had\nthat moment settled with Miss Tilney to take their proposed walk\nto-morrow; it was quite determined, and she would not, upon any account,\nretract. But that she _must_ and _should_ retract, was instantly the\neager cry of both the Thorpes; they must go to Clifton to-morrow, they\nwould not go without her, it would be nothing to put off a mere walk\nfor one day longer, and they would not hear of a refusal. Catherine was\ndistressed, but not subdued. “Do not urge me, Isabella. I am engaged to\nMiss Tilney. I cannot go.” This availed nothing. The same arguments\nassailed her again; she must go, she should go, and they would not hear\nof a refusal. “It would be so easy to tell Miss Tilney that you had\njust been reminded of a prior engagement, and must only beg to put off\nthe walk till Tuesday.”"

She was sure her dearest, sweetest Catherine would not\nseriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so\ndearly. She knew her beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart, so\nsweet a temper, to be so easily persuaded by those she loved. But all\nin vain; Catherine felt herself to be in the right, and though pained\nby such tender, such flattering supplication, could not allow it to\ninfluence her. Isabella then tried another method. She reproached her\nwith having more affection for Miss Tilney, though she had known her so\nlittle a while, than for her best and oldest friends, with being grown\ncold and indifferent, in short, towards herself. “I cannot help being\njealous, Catherine, when I see myself slighted for strangers, I, who\nlove you so excessively! when once my affections are placed, it is not\nin the power of anything to change them. But I believe my feelings are\nstronger than anybody’s; I am sure they are too strong for my own\npeace; and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers\ndoes cut me to the quick, I own. These Tilneys seem to swallow up\neverything else.”"

It was painful to her to\ndisappoint and displease them, particularly to displease her brother;\nbut she could not repent her resistance. Setting her own inclination\napart, to have failed a second time in her engagement to Miss Tilney,\nto have retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before,\nand on a false pretence too, must have been wrong. She had not been\nwithstanding them on selfish principles alone, she had not consulted\nmerely her own gratification; _that_ might have been ensured in some\ndegree by the excursion itself, by seeing Blaize Castle; no, she had\nattended to what was due to others, and to her own character in their\nopinion. Her conviction of being right, however, was not enough to\nrestore her composure; till she had spoken to Miss Tilney she could not\nbe at ease; and quickening her pace when she got clear of the Crescent,\nshe almost ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top of\nMilsom Street. So rapid had been her movements that in spite of the\nTilneys’ advantage in the outset, they were but just turning into their\nlodgings as she came within view of them; and the servant still\nremaining at the open door, she used only the ceremony of saying that\nshe must speak with Miss Tilney that moment, and hurrying by him\nproceeded upstairs. Then, opening the first door before her, which\nhappened to be the right, she immediately found herself in the\ndrawing-room with General Tilney, his son, and daughter. Her\nexplanation, defective only in being—from her irritation of nerves and\nshortness of breath—no explanation at all, was instantly given. “I am\ncome in a great hurry—It was all a mistake—I never promised to go—I\ntold them from the first I could not go.—I ran away in a great hurry to\nexplain it.—I did not care what you thought of me.—I would not stay for\nthe servant.”"

To such\nanxious attention was the General’s civility carried, that not aware of\nher extraordinary swiftness in entering the house, he was quite angry\nwith the servant whose neglect had reduced her to open the door of the\napartment herself. “What did William mean by it? He should make a point\nof inquiring into the matter.” And if Catherine had not most warmly\nasserted his innocence, it seemed likely that William would lose the\nfavour of his master forever, if not his place, by her rapidity."

Miss Tilney added her own wishes. Catherine was\ngreatly obliged; but it was quite out of her power. Mr. and Mrs. Allen\nwould expect her back every moment. The General declared he could say\nno more; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded;\nbut on some other day he trusted, when longer notice could be given,\nthey would not refuse to spare her to her friend. “Oh, no; Catherine\nwas sure they would not have the least objection, and she should have\ngreat pleasure in coming.” The General attended her himself to the\nstreet-door, saying everything gallant as they went downstairs,\nadmiring the elasticity of her walk, which corresponded exactly with\nthe spirit of her dancing, and making her one of the most graceful bows\nshe had ever beheld, when they parted."

She reached home without\nseeing anything more of the offended party; and now that she had been\ntriumphant throughout, had carried her point, and was secure of her\nwalk, she began (as the flutter of her spirits subsided) to doubt\nwhether she had been perfectly right. A sacrifice was always noble; and\nif she had given way to their entreaties, she should have been spared\nthe distressing idea of a friend displeased, a brother angry, and a\nscheme of great happiness to both destroyed, perhaps through her means.\nTo ease her mind, and ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced\nperson what her own conduct had really been, she took occasion to\nmention before Mr. Allen the half-settled scheme of her brother and the\nThorpes for the following day. Mr. Allen caught at it directly. “Well,”\nsaid he, “and do you think of going too?”"

They were viewing the country with the\neyes of persons accustomed to drawing, and decided on its capability of\nbeing formed into pictures, with all the eagerness of real taste. Here\nCatherine was quite lost. She knew nothing of drawing—nothing of taste:\nand she listened to them with an attention which brought her little\nprofit, for they talked in phrases which conveyed scarcely any idea to\nher. The little which she could understand, however, appeared to\ncontradict the very few notions she had entertained on the matter\nbefore. It seemed as if a good view were no longer to be taken from the\ntop of an high hill, and that a clear blue sky was no longer a proof of\na fine day. She was heartily ashamed of her ignorance. A misplaced\nshame. Where people wish to attach, they should always be ignorant. To\ncome with a well-informed mind is to come with an inability of\nadministering to the vanity of others, which a sensible person would\nalways wish to avoid. A woman especially, if she have the misfortune of\nknowing anything, should conceal it as well as she can."

But Catherine did not know her own\nadvantages—did not know that a good-looking girl, with an affectionate\nheart and a very ignorant mind, cannot fail of attracting a clever\nyoung man, unless circumstances are particularly untoward. In the\npresent instance, she confessed and lamented her want of knowledge,\ndeclared that she would give anything in the world to be able to draw;\nand a lecture on the picturesque immediately followed, in which his\ninstructions were so clear that she soon began to see beauty in\neverything admired by him, and her attention was so earnest that he\nbecame perfectly satisfied of her having a great deal of natural taste.\nHe talked of foregrounds, distances, and second distances—side-screens\nand perspectives—lights and shades; and Catherine was so hopeful a\nscholar that when they gained the top of Beechen Cliff, she voluntarily\nrejected the whole city of Bath as unworthy to make part of a\nlandscape. Delighted with her progress, and fearful of wearying her\nwith too much wisdom at once, Henry suffered the subject to decline,\nand by an easy transition from a piece of rocky fragment and the\nwithered oak which he had placed near its summit, to oaks in general,\nto forests, the enclosure of them, waste lands, crown lands and\ngovernment, he shortly found himself arrived at politics; and from\npolitics, it was an easy step to silence. The general pause which\nsucceeded his short disquisition on the state of the nation was put an\nend to by Catherine, who, in rather a solemn tone of voice, uttered\nthese words, “I have heard that something very shocking indeed will\nsoon come out in London.”"

The anxious affection, which she was accused of having\ncontinually watched in Isabella’s every look and action, had, in the\ncourse of their yesterday’s party, received the delightful confession\nof an equal love. Her heart and faith were alike engaged to James.\nNever had Catherine listened to anything so full of interest, wonder,\nand joy. Her brother and her friend engaged! new to such circumstances,\nthe importance of it appeared unspeakably great, and she contemplated\nit as one of those grand events, of which the ordinary course of life\ncan hardly afford a return. The strength of her feelings she could not\nexpress; the nature of them, however, contented her friend. The\nhappiness of having such a sister was their first effusion, and the\nfair ladies mingled in embraces and tears of joy."

    "text": "The agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her\nbrother’s engagement made her expect to raise no inconsiderable emotion\nin Mr. and Mrs. Allen, by the communication of the wonderful event. How\ngreat was her disappointment! the important affair, which many words of\npreparation ushered in, had been foreseen by them both ever since her\nbrother’s arrival; and all that they felt on the occasion was\ncomprehended in a wish for the young people’s happiness, with a remark,\non the gentleman’s side, in favour of Isabella’s beauty, and on the\nlady’s, of her great good luck. It was to Catherine the most surprising\ninsensibility. The disclosure, however, of the great secret of James’s\ngoing to Fullerton the day before, did raise some emotion in Mrs.\nAllen. She could not listen to that with perfect calmness, but\nrepeatedly regretted the necessity of its concealment, wished she could\nhave known his intention, wished she could have seen him before he\nwent, as she should certainly have troubled him with her best regards\nto his father and mother, and her kind compliments to all the Skinners."

    "text": "Catherine’s expectations of pleasure from her visit in Milsom Street\nwere so very high that disappointment was inevitable; and accordingly,\nthough she was most politely received by General Tilney, and kindly\nwelcomed by his daughter, though Henry was at home, and no one else of\nthe party, she found, on her return, without spending many hours in the\nexamination of her feelings, that she had gone to her appointment\npreparing for happiness which it had not afforded. Instead of finding\nherself improved in acquaintance with Miss Tilney, from the intercourse\nof the day, she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before; instead\nof seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever, in the ease of a\nfamily party, he had never said so little, nor been so little\nagreeable; and, in spite of their father’s great civilities to her—in\nspite of his thanks, invitations, and compliments—it had been a release\nto get away from him. It puzzled her to account for all this. It could\nnot be General Tilney’s fault. That he was perfectly agreeable and\ngood-natured, and altogether a very charming man, did not admit of a\ndoubt, for he was tall and handsome, and Henry’s father. _He_ could not\nbe accountable for his children’s want of spirits, or for her want of\nenjoyment in his company. The former she hoped at last might have been\naccidental, and the latter she could only attribute to her own\nstupidity. Isabella, on hearing the particulars of the visit, gave a\ndifferent explanation: “It was all pride, pride, insufferable\nhaughtiness and pride! she had long suspected the family to be very\nhigh, and this made it certain. Such insolence of behaviour as Miss\nTilney’s she had never heard of in her life! not to do the honours of\nher house with common good breeding! to behave to her guest with such\nsuperciliousness! hardly even to speak to her!”"

    "text": "Having heard the day before in Milsom Street that their elder brother,\nCaptain Tilney, was expected almost every hour, she was at no loss for\nthe name of a very fashionable-looking, handsome young man, whom she\nhad never seen before, and who now evidently belonged to their party.\nShe looked at him with great admiration, and even supposed it possible\nthat some people might think him handsomer than his brother, though, in\nher eyes, his air was more assuming, and his countenance less\nprepossessing. His taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly\ninferior; for, within her hearing, he not only protested against every\nthought of dancing himself, but even laughed openly at Henry for\nfinding it possible. From the latter circumstance it may be presumed\nthat, whatever might be our heroine’s opinion of him, his admiration of\nher was not of a very dangerous kind; not likely to produce animosities\nbetween the brothers, nor persecutions to the lady. _He_ cannot be the\ninstigator of the three villains in horsemen’s greatcoats, by whom she\nwill hereafter be forced into a traveling-chaise and four, which will\ndrive off with incredible speed. Catherine, meanwhile, undisturbed by\npresentiments of such an evil, or of any evil at all, except that of\nhaving but a short set to dance down, enjoyed her usual happiness with\nHenry Tilney, listening with sparkling eyes to everything he said; and,\nin finding him irresistible, becoming so herself."

Her suspense was of full five minutes’\nduration; and she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an\nhour, when they both returned, and an explanation was given, by Henry’s\nrequesting to know, if she thought her friend, Miss Thorpe, would have\nany objection to dancing, as his brother would be most happy to be\nintroduced to her. Catherine, without hesitation, replied that she was\nvery sure Miss Thorpe did not mean to dance at all. The cruel reply was\npassed on to the other, and he immediately walked away."

A living, of which Mr.\nMorland was himself patron and incumbent, of about four hundred pounds\nyearly value, was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old\nenough to take it; no trifling deduction from the family income, no\nniggardly assignment to one of ten children. An estate of at least\nequal value, moreover, was assured as his future inheritance."

What this additional fortnight was to\nproduce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing Henry Tilney\nmade but a small part of Catherine’s speculation. Once or twice indeed,\nsince James’s engagement had taught her what _could_ be done, she had\ngot so far as to indulge in a secret “perhaps,” but in general the\nfelicity of being with him for the present bounded her views: the\npresent was now comprised in another three weeks, and her happiness\nbeing certain for that period, the rest of her life was at such a\ndistance as to excite but little interest. In the course of the morning\nwhich saw this business arranged, she visited Miss Tilney, and poured\nforth her joyful feelings. It was doomed to be a day of trial. No\nsooner had she expressed her delight in Mr. Allen’s lengthened stay\nthan Miss Tilney told her of her father’s having just determined upon\nquitting Bath by the end of another week. Here was a blow! the past\nsuspense of the morning had been ease and quiet to the present\ndisappointment. Catherine’s countenance fell, and in a voice of most\nsincere concern she echoed Miss Tilney’s concluding words, “By the end\nof another week!”"

Mr. and Mrs. Morland, relying on the\ndiscretion of the friends to whom they had already entrusted their\ndaughter, felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which had\nbeen formed under their eye, and sent therefore by return of post their\nready consent to her visit in Gloucestershire. This indulgence, though\nnot more than Catherine had hoped for, completed her conviction of\nbeing favoured beyond every other human creature, in friends and\nfortune, circumstance and chance. Everything seemed to cooperate for\nher advantage. By the kindness of her first friends, the Allens, she\nhad been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met\nher. Her feelings, her preferences, had each known the happiness of a\nreturn. Wherever she felt attachment, she had been able to create it.\nThe affection of Isabella was to be secured to her in a sister. The\nTilneys, they, by whom, above all, she desired to be favourably thought\nof, outstripped even her wishes in the flattering measures by which\ntheir intimacy was to be continued. She was to be their chosen visitor,\nshe was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose\nsociety she mostly prized—and, in addition to all the rest, this roof\nwas to be the roof of an abbey! her passion for ancient edifices was\nnext in degree to her passion for Henry Tilney—and castles and abbeys\nmade usually the charm of those reveries which his image did not fill.\nTo see and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one, or the\ncloisters of the other, had been for many weeks a darling wish, though\nto be more than the visitor of an hour had seemed too nearly impossible\nfor desire. And yet, this was to happen. With all the chances against\nher of house, hall, place, park, court, and cottage, Northanger turned\nup an abbey, and she was to be its inhabitant. Its long, damp passages,\nits narrow cells and ruined chapel, were to be within her daily reach,\nand she could not entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legends,\nsome awful memorials of an injured and ill-fated nun."

I _do_ remember now being with you, and\nseeing him as well as the rest—but that we were ever alone for five\nminutes— However, it is not worth arguing about, for whatever might pass\non his side, you must be convinced, by my having no recollection of it,\nthat I never thought, nor expected, nor wished for anything of the kind\nfrom him. I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for\nme—but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side; I never had\nthe smallest idea of it. Pray undeceive him as soon as you can, and\ntell him I beg his pardon—that is—I do not know what I ought to say—but\nmake him understand what I mean, in the properest way. I would not\nspeak disrespectfully of a brother of yours, Isabella, I am sure; but\nyou know very well that if I could think of one man more than\nanother—_he_ is not the person.” Isabella was silent. “My dear friend,\nyou must not be angry with me. I cannot suppose your brother cares so\nvery much about me. And, you know, we shall still be sisters.”"

Amazed that Isabella could endure it, and jealous for her\nbrother, she rose up, and saying she should join Mrs. Allen, proposed\ntheir walking. But for this Isabella showed no inclination. She was so\namazingly tired, and it was so odious to parade about the pump-room;\nand if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters; she was\nexpecting her sisters every moment; so that her dearest Catherine must\nexcuse her, and must sit quietly down again. But Catherine could be\nstubborn too; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their\nreturning home, she joined her and walked out of the pump-room, leaving\nIsabella still sitting with Captain Tilney. With much uneasiness did\nshe thus leave them. It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling\nin love with Isabella, and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him;\nunconsciously it must be, for Isabella’s attachment to James was as\ncertain and well acknowledged as her engagement. To doubt her truth or\ngood intentions was impossible; and yet, during the whole of their\nconversation her manner had been odd. She wished Isabella had talked\nmore like her usual self, and not so much about money, and had not\nlooked so well pleased at the sight of Captain Tilney. How strange that\nshe should not perceive his admiration! catherine longed to give her a\nhint of it, to put her on her guard, and prevent all the pain which her\ntoo lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her\nbrother."

In\nvanity, therefore, she gained but little; her chief profit was in\nwonder. That he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in\nlove with her was a matter of lively astonishment. Isabella talked of\nhis attentions; _she_ had never been sensible of any; but Isabella had\nsaid many things which she hoped had been spoken in haste, and would\nnever be said again; and upon this she was glad to rest altogether for\npresent ease and comfort."

    "text": "A few days passed away, and Catherine, though not allowing herself to\nsuspect her friend, could not help watching her closely. The result of\nher observations was not agreeable. Isabella seemed an altered\ncreature. When she saw her, indeed, surrounded only by their immediate\nfriends in Edgar’s Buildings or Pulteney Street, her change of manners\nwas so trifling that, had it gone no farther, it might have passed\nunnoticed. A something of languid indifference, or of that boasted\nabsence of mind which Catherine had never heard of before, would\noccasionally come across her; but had nothing worse appeared, _that_\nmight only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest. But\nwhen Catherine saw her in public, admitting Captain Tilney’s attentions\nas readily as they were offered, and allowing him almost an equal share\nwith James in her notice and smiles, the alteration became too positive\nto be passed over. What could be meant by such unsteady conduct, what\nher friend could be at, was beyond her comprehension. Isabella could\nnot be aware of the pain she was inflicting; but it was a degree of\nwilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent. James was\nthe sufferer. She saw him grave and uneasy; and however careless of his\npresent comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart, to\n_her_ it was always an object. For poor Captain Tilney too she was\ngreatly concerned. Though his looks did not please her, his name was a\npassport to her goodwill, and she thought with sincere compassion of\nhis approaching disappointment; for, in spite of what she had believed\nherself to overhear in the pump-room, his behaviour was so incompatible\nwith a knowledge of Isabella’s engagement that she could not, upon\nreflection, imagine him aware of it. He might be jealous of her brother\nas a rival, but if more had seemed implied, the fault must have been in\nher misapprehension. She wished, by a gentle remonstrance, to remind\nIsabella of her situation, and make her aware of this double\nunkindness; but for remonstrance, either opportunity or comprehension\nwas always against her. If able to suggest a hint, Isabella could never\nunderstand it. In this distress, the intended departure of the Tilney\nfamily became her chief consolation; their journey into Gloucestershire\nwas to take place within a few days, and Captain Tilney’s removal would\nat least restore peace to every heart but his own. But Captain Tilney\nhad at present no intention of removing; he was not to be of the party\nto Northanger; he was to continue at Bath. When Catherine knew this,\nher resolution was directly made. She spoke to Henry Tilney on the\nsubject, regretting his brother’s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe,\nand entreating him to make known her prior engagement."

Would he thank you, either on his own account\nor Miss Thorpe’s, for supposing that her affection, or at least her\ngood behaviour, is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain\nTilney? Is he safe only in solitude? Or is her heart constant to him\nonly when unsolicited by anyone else? He cannot think this—and you may\nbe sure that he would not have you think it. I will not say, ‘Do not be\nuneasy,’ because I know that you are so, at this moment; but be as\nlittle uneasy as you can. You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of\nyour brother and your friend; depend upon it, therefore, that real\njealousy never can exist between them; depend upon it that no\ndisagreement between them can be of any duration. Their hearts are open\nto each other, as neither heart can be to you; they know exactly what\nis required and what can be borne; and you may be certain that one will\nnever tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant.”"

Her\nhappiness in going with Miss Tilney, however, prevented their wishing\nit otherwise; and, as they were to remain only one more week in Bath\nthemselves, her quitting them now would not long be felt. Mr. Allen\nattended her to Milsom Street, where she was to breakfast, and saw her\nseated with the kindest welcome among her new friends; but so great was\nher agitation in finding herself as one of the family, and so fearful\nwas she of not doing exactly what was right, and of not being able to\npreserve their good opinion, that, in the embarrassment of the first\nfive minutes, she could almost have wished to return with him to\nPulteney Street."

Nay, perverse as it seemed, she doubted whether she might not have\nfelt less, had she been less attended to. His anxiety for her\ncomfort—his continual solicitations that she would eat, and his\noften-expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste—though never\nin her life before had she beheld half such variety on a\nbreakfast-table—made it impossible for her to forget for a moment that\nshe was a visitor. She felt utterly unworthy of such respect, and knew\nnot how to reply to it. Her tranquillity was not improved by the\nGeneral’s impatience for the appearance of his eldest son, nor by the\ndispleasure he expressed at his laziness when Captain Tilney at last\ncame down. She was quite pained by the severity of his father’s\nreproof, which seemed disproportionate to the offence; and much was her\nconcern increased when she found herself the principal cause of the\nlecture, and that his tardiness was chiefly resented from being\ndisrespectful to her. This was placing her in a very uncomfortable\nsituation, and she felt great compassion for Captain Tilney, without\nbeing able to hope for his goodwill."

    "text": "The bustle of going was not pleasant. The clock struck ten while the\ntrunks were carrying down, and the General had fixed to be out of\nMilsom Street by that hour. His greatcoat, instead of being brought for\nhim to put on directly, was spread out in the curricle in which he was\nto accompany his son. The middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out,\nthough there were three people to go in it, and his daughter’s maid had\nso crowded it with parcels that Miss Morland would not have room to\nsit; and, so much was he influenced by this apprehension when he handed\nher in, that she had some difficulty in saving her own new writing-desk\nfrom being thrown out into the street. At last, however, the door was\nclosed upon the three females, and they set off at the sober pace in\nwhich the handsome, highly fed four horses of a gentleman usually\nperform a journey of thirty miles: such was the distance of Northanger\nfrom Bath, to be now divided into two equal stages. Catherine’s spirits\nrevived as they drove from the door; for with Miss Tilney she felt no\nrestraint; and, with the interest of a road entirely new to her, of an\nabbey before, and a curricle behind, she caught the last view of Bath\nwithout any regret, and met with every milestone before she expected\nit. The tediousness of a two hours’ wait at Petty France, in which\nthere was nothing to be done but to eat without being hungry, and\nloiter about without anything to see, next followed—and her admiration\nof the style in which they travelled, of the fashionable chaise and\nfour—postilions handsomely liveried, rising so regularly in their\nstirrups, and numerous outriders properly mounted, sunk a little under\nthis consequent inconvenience. Had their party been perfectly\nagreeable, the delay would have been nothing; but General Tilney,\nthough so charming a man, seemed always a check upon his children’s\nspirits, and scarcely anything was said but by himself; the observation\nof which, with his discontent at whatever the inn afforded, and his\nangry impatience at the waiters, made Catherine grow every moment more\nin awe of him, and appeared to lengthen the two hours into four. At\nlast, however, the order of release was given; and much was Catherine\nthen surprised by the General’s proposal of her taking his place in his\nson’s curricle for the rest of the journey: “the day was fine, and he\nwas anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible.”"

A very short trial\nconvinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world;\nthe chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur, to be sure, but it\nwas a heavy and troublesome business, and she could not easily forget\nits having stopped two hours at Petty France. Half the time would have\nbeen enough for the curricle, and so nimbly were the light horses\ndisposed to move, that, had not the General chosen to have his own\ncarriage lead the way, they could have passed it with ease in half a\nminute. But the merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses;\nHenry drove so well—so quietly—without making any disturbance, without\nparading to her, or swearing at them: so different from the only\ngentleman-coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with! and\nthen his hat sat so well, and the innumerable capes of his greatcoat\nlooked so becomingly important! to be driven by him, next to being\ndancing with him, was certainly the greatest happiness in the world. In\naddition to every other delight, she had now that of listening to her\nown praise; of being thanked at least, on his sister’s account, for her\nkindness in thus becoming her visitor; of hearing it ranked as real\nfriendship, and described as creating real gratitude. His sister, he\nsaid, was uncomfortably circumstanced—she had no female companion—and,\nin the frequent absence of her father, was sometimes without any\ncompanion at all."

The\nbreeze had not seemed to waft the sighs of the murdered to her; it had\nwafted nothing worse than a thick mizzling rain; and having given a\ngood shake to her habit, she was ready to be shown into the common\ndrawing-room, and capable of considering where she was."

The furniture was\nin all the profusion and elegance of modern taste. The fireplace, where\nshe had expected the ample width and ponderous carving of former times,\nwas contracted to a Rumford, with slabs of plain though handsome\nmarble, and ornaments over it of the prettiest English china. The\nwindows, to which she looked with peculiar dependence, from having\nheard the General talk of his preserving them in their Gothic form with\nreverential care, were yet less what her fancy had portrayed. To be\nsure, the pointed arch was preserved—the form of them was Gothic—they\nmight be even casements—but every pane was so large, so clear, so\nlight! to an imagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions,\nand the heaviest stone-work, for painted glass, dirt, and cobwebs, the\ndifference was very distressing."

The lock was silver, though tarnished from age; at\neach end were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver, broken\nperhaps prematurely by some strange violence; and, on the centre of the\nlid, was a mysterious cipher, in the same metal. Catherine bent over it\nintently, but without being able to distinguish anything with\ncertainty. She could not, in whatever direction she took it, believe\nthe last letter to be a _T;_ and yet that it should be anything else in\nthat house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of\nastonishment.

Catherine, as she crossed the hall, listened to the tempest\nwith sensations of awe; and, when she heard it rage round a corner of\nthe ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door, felt\nfor the first time that she was really in an abbey. Yes, these were\ncharacteristic sounds; they brought to her recollection a countless\nvariety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes, which such buildings\nhad witnessed, and such storms ushered in; and most heartily did she\nrejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within\nwalls so solemn! _She_ had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or\ndrunken gallants. Henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had\ntold her that morning. In a house so furnished, and so guarded, she\ncould have nothing to explore or to suffer, and might go to her bedroom\nas securely as if it had been her own chamber at Fullerton. Thus wisely\nfortifying her mind, as she proceeded upstairs, she was enabled,\nespecially on perceiving that Miss Tilney slept only two doors from\nher, to enter her room with a tolerably stout heart; and her spirits\nwere immediately assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire. “How\nmuch better is this,” said she, as she walked to the fender—“how much\nbetter to find a fire ready lit, than to have to wait shivering in the\ncold till all the family are in bed, as so many poor girls have been\nobliged to do, and then to have a faithful old servant frightening one\nby coming in with a faggot! how glad I am that Northanger is what it\nis! if it had been like some other places, I do not know that, in such\na night as this, I could have answered for my courage: but now, to be\nsure, there is nothing to alarm one.”"

It\ncould be nothing but the violence of the wind penetrating through the\ndivisions of the shutters; and she stepped boldly forward, carelessly\nhumming a tune, to assure herself of its being so, peeped courageously\nbehind each curtain, saw nothing on either low window seat to scare\nher, and on placing a hand against the shutter, felt the strongest\nconviction of the wind’s force. A glance at the old chest, as she\nturned away from this examination, was not without its use; she scorned\nthe causeless fears of an idle fancy, and began with a most happy\nindifference to prepare herself for bed. “She should take her time; she\nshould not hurry herself; she did not care if she were the last person\nup in the house. But she would not make up her fire; _that_ would seem\ncowardly, as if she wished for the protection of light after she were\nin bed.” The fire therefore died away, and Catherine, having spent the\nbest part of an hour in her arrangements, was beginning to think of\nstepping into bed, when, on giving a parting glance round the room, she\nwas struck by the appearance of a high, old-fashioned black cabinet,\nwhich, though in a situation conspicuous enough, had never caught her\nnotice before. Henry’s words, his description of the ebony cabinet\nwhich was to escape her observation at first, immediately rushed across\nher; and though there could be nothing really in it, there was\nsomething whimsical, it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence!\nShe took her candle and looked closely at the cabinet. It was not\nabsolutely ebony and gold; but it was japan, black and yellow japan of\nthe handsomest kind; and as she held her candle, the yellow had very\nmuch the effect of gold. The key was in the door, and she had a strange\nfancy to look into it; not, however, with the smallest expectation of\nfinding anything, but it was so very odd, after what Henry had said. In\nshort, she could not sleep till she had examined it. So, placing the\ncandle with great caution on a chair, she seized the key with a very\ntremulous hand and tried to turn it; but it resisted her utmost\nstrength. Alarmed, but not discouraged, she tried it another way; a\nbolt flew, and she believed herself successful; but how strangely\nmysterious! the door was still immovable. She paused a moment in\nbreathless wonder. The wind roared down the chimney, the rain beat in\ntorrents against the windows, and everything seemed to speak the\nawfulness of her situation. To retire to bed, however, unsatisfied on\nsuch a point, would be vain, since sleep must be impossible with the\nconsciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed in her immediate\nvicinity. Again, therefore, she applied herself to the key, and after\nmoving it in every possible way for some instants with the determined\ncelerity of hope’s last effort, the door suddenly yielded to her hand:\nher heart leaped with exultation at such a victory, and having thrown\nopen each folding door, the second being secured only by bolts of less\nwonderful construction than the lock, though in that her eye could not\ndiscern anything unusual, a double range of small drawers appeared in\nview, with some larger drawers above and below them; and in the centre,\na small door, closed also with a lock and key, secured in all\nprobability a cavity of importance."

With a\ncheek flushed by hope, and an eye straining with curiosity, her fingers\ngrasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth. It was entirely\nempty. With less alarm and greater eagerness she seized a second, a\nthird, a fourth; each was equally empty. Not one was left unsearched,\nand in not one was anything found. Well read in the art of concealing a\ntreasure, the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not\nescape her, and she felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain. The\nplace in the middle alone remained now unexplored; and though she had\n“never from the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any\npart of the cabinet, and was not in the least disappointed at her ill\nsuccess thus far, it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly\nwhile she was about it.” It was some time however before she could\nunfasten the door, the same difficulty occurring in the management of\nthis inner lock as of the outer; but at length it did open; and not\nvain, as hitherto, was her search; her quick eyes directly fell on a\nroll of paper pushed back into the further part of the cavity,\napparently for concealment, and her feelings at that moment were\nindescribable. Her heart fluttered, her knees trembled, and her cheeks\ngrew pale. She seized, with an unsteady hand, the precious manuscript,\nfor half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters; and while\nshe acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of\nwhat Henry had foretold, resolved instantly to peruse every line before\nshe attempted to rest."

Alas! it was snuffed and extinguished\nin one. A lamp could not have expired with more awful effect.\nCatherine, for a few moments, was motionless with horror. It was done\ncompletely; not a remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the\nrekindling breath. Darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room.\nA violent gust of wind, rising with sudden fury, added fresh horror to\nthe moment. Catherine trembled from head to foot. In the pause which\nsucceeded, a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant\ndoor struck on her affrighted ear. Human nature could support no more.\nA cold sweat stood on her forehead, the manuscript fell from her hand,\nand groping her way to the bed, she jumped hastily in, and sought some\nsuspension of agony by creeping far underneath the clothes. To close\nher eyes in sleep that night, she felt must be entirely out of the\nquestion. With a curiosity so justly awakened, and feelings in every\nway so agitated, repose must be absolutely impossible. The storm too\nabroad so dreadful! she had not been used to feel alarm from wind, but\nnow every blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence. The manuscript\nso wonderfully found, so wonderfully accomplishing the morning’s\nprediction, how was it to be accounted for? What could it contain? To\nwhom could it relate? By what means could it have been so long\nconcealed? And how singularly strange that it should fall to her lot to\ndiscover it! till she had made herself mistress of its contents,\nhowever, she could have neither repose nor comfort; and with the sun’s\nfirst rays she was determined to peruse it. But many were the tedious\nhours which must yet intervene. She shuddered, tossed about in her bed,\nand envied every quiet sleeper. The storm still raged, and various were\nthe noises, more terrific even than the wind, which struck at intervals\non her startled ear. The very curtains of her bed seemed at one moment\nin motion, and at another the lock of her door was agitated, as if by\nthe attempt of somebody to enter. Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along\nthe gallery, and more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of\ndistant moans. Hour after hour passed away, and the wearied Catherine\nhad heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the\ntempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep."

Henry was alone in it; and his immediate\nhope of her having been undisturbed by the tempest, with an arch\nreference to the character of the building they inhabited, was rather\ndistressing. For the world would she not have her weakness suspected,\nand yet, unequal to an absolute falsehood, was constrained to\nacknowledge that the wind had kept her awake a little. “But we have a\ncharming morning after it,” she added, desiring to get rid of the\nsubject; “and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over.\nWhat beautiful hyacinths! i have just learnt to love a hyacinth.”"

The\nnetting-box, just leisurely drawn forth, was closed with joyful haste,\nand she was ready to attend him in a moment. “And when they had gone\nover the house, he promised himself moreover the pleasure of\naccompanying her into the shrubberies and garden.” She curtsied her\nacquiescence. “But perhaps it might be more agreeable to her to make\nthose her first object. The weather was at present favourable, and at\nthis time of year the uncertainty was very great of its continuing so.\nWhich would she prefer? He was equally at her service. Which did his\ndaughter think would most accord with her fair friend’s wishes? But he\nthought he could discern. Yes, he certainly read in Miss Morland’s eyes\na judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather. But\nwhen did she judge amiss? The abbey would be always safe and dry. He\nyielded implicitly, and would fetch his hat and attend them in a\nmoment.” He left the room, and Catherine, with a disappointed, anxious\nface, began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them\nout of doors against his own inclination, under a mistaken idea of\npleasing her; but she was stopped by Miss Tilney’s saying, with a\nlittle confusion, “I believe it will be wisest to take the morning\nwhile it is so fine; and do not be uneasy on my father’s account; he\nalways walks out at this time of day.”"

Miss Tilney, understanding in part her friend’s\ncuriosity to see the house, soon revived the subject; and her father\nbeing, contrary to Catherine’s expectations, unprovided with any\npretence for further delay, beyond that of stopping five minutes to\norder refreshments to be in the room by their return, was at last ready\nto escort them."

    "text": "They set forward; and, with a grandeur of air, a dignified step, which\ncaught the eye, but could not shake the doubts of the well-read\nCatherine, he led the way across the hall, through the common\ndrawing-room and one useless antechamber, into a room magnificent both\nin size and furniture—the real drawing-room, used only with company of\nconsequence. It was very noble—very grand—very charming!—was all that\nCatherine had to say, for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned\nthe colour of the satin; and all minuteness of praise, all praise that\nhad much meaning, was supplied by the General: the costliness or\nelegance of any room’s fitting-up could be nothing to her; she cared\nfor no furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century. When\nthe General had satisfied his own curiosity, in a close examination of\nevery well-known ornament, they proceeded into the library, an\napartment, in its way, of equal magnificence, exhibiting a collection\nof books, on which an humble man might have looked with pride.\nCatherine heard, admired, and wondered with more genuine feeling than\nbefore—gathered all that she could from this storehouse of knowledge,\nby running over the titles of half a shelf, and was ready to proceed.\nBut suites of apartments did not spring up with her wishes. Large as\nwas the building, she had already visited the greatest part; though, on\nbeing told that, with the addition of the kitchen, the six or seven\nrooms she had now seen surrounded three sides of the court, she could\nscarcely believe it, or overcome the suspicion of there being many\nchambers secreted. It was some relief, however, that they were to\nreturn to the rooms in common use, by passing through a few of less\nimportance, looking into the court, which, with occasional passages,\nnot wholly unintricate, connected the different sides; and she was\nfurther soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading\nwhat had once been a cloister, having traces of cells pointed out, and\nobserving several doors that were neither opened nor explained to\nher—by finding herself successively in a billiard-room, and in the\nGeneral’s private apartment, without comprehending their connection, or\nbeing able to turn aright when she left them; and lastly, by passing\nthrough a dark little room, owning Henry’s authority, and strewed with\nhis litter of books, guns, and greatcoats."

The General’s improving hand had\nnot loitered here: every modern invention to facilitate the labour of\nthe cooks had been adopted within this, their spacious theatre; and,\nwhen the genius of others had failed, his own had often produced the\nperfection wanted.

All that was venerable ceased here. The new building was not\nonly new, but declared itself to be so; intended only for offices, and\nenclosed behind by stable-yards, no uniformity of architecture had been\nthought necessary. Catherine could have raved at the hand which had\nswept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest, for\nthe purposes of mere domestic economy; and would willingly have been\nspared the mortification of a walk through scenes so fallen, had the\nGeneral allowed it; but if he had a vanity, it was in the arrangement\nof his offices; and as he was convinced that, to a mind like Miss\nMorland’s, a view of the accommodations and comforts by which the\nlabours of her inferiors were softened, must always be gratifying, he\nshould make no apology for leading her on. They took a slight survey of\nall; and Catherine was impressed, beyond her expectation, by their\nmultiplicity and their convenience. The purposes for which a few\nshapeless pantries and a comfortless scullery were deemed sufficient at\nFullerton, were here carried on in appropriate divisions, commodious\nand roomy. The number of servants continually appearing did not strike\nher less than the number of their offices. Wherever they went, some\npattened girl stopped to curtsy, or some footman in dishabille sneaked\noff. Yet this was an abbey! how inexpressibly different in these\ndomestic arrangements from such as she had read about—from abbeys and\ncastles, in which, though certainly larger than Northanger, all the\ndirty work of the house was to be done by two pair of female hands at\nthe utmost. How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs.\nAllen; and, when Catherine saw what was necessary here, she began to be\namazed herself."

She was here\nshown successively into three large bed-chambers, with their\ndressing-rooms, most completely and handsomely fitted up; everything\nthat money and taste could do, to give comfort and elegance to\napartments, had been bestowed on these; and, being furnished within the\nlast five years, they were perfect in all that would be generally\npleasing, and wanting in all that could give pleasure to Catherine. As\nthey were surveying the last, the General, after slightly naming a few\nof the distinguished characters by whom they had at times been\nhonoured, turned with a smiling countenance to Catherine, and ventured\nto hope that henceforward some of their earliest tenants might be “our\nfriends from Fullerton.” She felt the unexpected compliment, and deeply\nregretted the impossibility of thinking well of a man so kindly\ndisposed towards herself, and so full of civility to all her family."

Miss\nTilney drew back directly, and the heavy doors were closed upon the\nmortified Catherine, who, having seen, in a momentary glance beyond\nthem, a narrower passage, more numerous openings, and symptoms of a\nwinding staircase, believed herself at last within the reach of\nsomething worth her notice; and felt, as she unwillingly paced back the\ngallery, that she would rather be allowed to examine that end of the\nhouse than see all the finery of all the rest. The General’s evident\ndesire of preventing such an examination was an additional stimulant.\nSomething was certainly to be concealed; her fancy, though it had\ntrespassed lately once or twice, could not mislead her here; and what\nthat something was, a short sentence of Miss Tilney’s, as they followed\nthe General at some distance downstairs, seemed to point out: “I was\ngoing to take you into what was my mother’s room—the room in which she\ndied—” were all her words; but few as they were, they conveyed pages of\nintelligence to Catherine. It was no wonder that the General should\nshrink from the sight of such objects as that room must contain; a room\nin all probability never entered by him since the dreadful scene had\npassed, which released his suffering wife, and left him to the stings\nof conscience."

To\nwhat might not those doors lead? In support of the plausibility of this\nconjecture, it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery, in\nwhich lay the apartments of the unfortunate Mrs. Tilney, must be, as\ncertainly as her memory could guide her, exactly over this suspected\nrange of cells, and the staircase by the side of those apartments of\nwhich she had caught a transient glimpse, communicating by some secret\nmeans with those cells, might well have favoured the barbarous\nproceedings of her husband.

Again\nshe passed through the folding doors, again her hand was upon the\nimportant lock, and Catherine, hardly able to breathe, was turning to\nclose the former with fearful caution, when the figure, the dreaded\nfigure of the General himself at the further end of the gallery, stood\nbefore her! the name of “Eleanor” at the same moment, in his loudest\ntone, resounded through the building, giving to his daughter the first\nintimation of his presence, and to Catherine terror upon terror. An\nattempt at concealment had been her first instinctive movement on\nperceiving him, yet she could scarcely hope to have escaped his eye;\nand when her friend, who with an apologizing look darted hastily by\nher, had joined and disappeared with him, she ran for safety to her own\nroom, and, locking herself in, believed that she should never have\ncourage to go down again.

The breakfast-room was gay\nwith company; and she was named to them by the General as the friend of\nhis daughter, in a complimentary style, which so well concealed his\nresentful ire, as to make her feel secure at least of life for the\npresent.

The lock yielded to her hand, and, luckily, with no\nsullen sound that could alarm a human being. On tiptoe she entered; the\nroom was before her; but it was some minutes before she could advance\nanother step. She beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every\nfeature. She saw a large, well-proportioned apartment, an handsome\ndimity bed, arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid’s care, a bright\nBath stove, mahogany wardrobes, and neatly painted chairs, on which the\nwarm beams of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows!\nCatherine had expected to have her feelings worked, and worked they\nwere. Astonishment and doubt first seized them; and a shortly\nsucceeding ray of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame. She\ncould not be mistaken as to the room; but how grossly mistaken in\neverything else!—in Miss Tilney’s meaning, in her own calculation! this\napartment, to which she had given a date so ancient, a position so\nawful, proved to be one end of what the General’s father had built.\nThere were two other doors in the chamber, leading probably into\ndressing-closets; but she had no inclination to open either. Would the\nveil in which Mrs. Tilney had last walked, or the volume in which she\nhad last read, remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper?\nNo: whatever might have been the General’s crimes, he had certainly too\nmuch wit to let them sue for detection. She was sick of exploring, and\ndesired but to be safe in her own room, with her own heart only privy\nto its folly; and she was on the point of retreating as softly as she\nhad entered, when the sound of footsteps, she could hardly tell where,\nmade her pause and tremble. To be found there, even by a servant, would\nbe unpleasant; but by the General (and he seemed always at hand when\nleast wanted), much worse! she listened—the sound had ceased; and\nresolving not to lose a moment, she passed through and closed the door.\nAt that instant a door underneath was hastily opened; someone seemed\nwith swift steps to ascend the stairs, by the head of which she had yet\nto pass before she could gain the gallery. She had no power to move.\nWith a feeling of terror not very definable, she fixed her eyes on the\nstaircase, and in a few moments it gave Henry to her view. “Mr.\nTilney!” she exclaimed in a voice of more than common astonishment. He\nlooked astonished too. “Good God!” she continued, not attending to his\naddress. “How came you here? How came you up that staircase?”"

Catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country, and even\nof that, if hard pressed, would have yielded the northern and western\nextremities. But in the central part of England there was surely some\nsecurity for the existence even of a wife not beloved, in the laws of\nthe land, and the manners of the age.

    "text": "Catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of\ncountenance, and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder, declared her\nto be receiving unpleasant news; and Henry, earnestly watching her\nthrough the whole letter, saw plainly that it ended no better than it\nbegan. He was prevented, however, from even looking his surprise by his\nfather’s entrance. They went to breakfast directly; but Catherine could\nhardly eat anything. Tears filled her eyes, and even ran down her\ncheeks as she sat. The letter was one moment in her hand, then in her\nlap, and then in her pocket; and she looked as if she knew not what she\ndid. The General, between his cocoa and his newspaper, had luckily no\nleisure for noticing her; but to the other two her distress was equally\nvisible. As soon as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her\nown room; but the housemaids were busy in it, and she was obliged to\ncome down again. She turned into the drawing-room for privacy, but\nHenry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither, and were at that\nmoment deep in consultation about her. She drew back, trying to beg\ntheir pardon, but was, with gentle violence, forced to return; and the\nothers withdrew, after Eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of\nbeing of use or comfort to her."

Perhaps, if\nparticularly questioned, she might just give an idea—just distantly\nhint at it—but not more. To expose a friend, such a friend as Isabella\nhad been to her—and then their own brother so closely concerned in it!\nShe believed she must waive the subject altogether. Henry and Eleanor\nwere by themselves in the breakfast-room; and each, as she entered it,\nlooked at her anxiously. Catherine took her place at the table, and,\nafter a short silence, Eleanor said, “No bad news from Fullerton, I\nhope? Mr. and Mrs. Morland—your brothers and sisters—I hope they are\nnone of them ill?”"

Their persuasion that the General\nwould, upon this ground alone, independent of the objection that might\nbe raised against her character, oppose the connection, turned her\nfeelings moreover with some alarm towards herself. She was as\ninsignificant, and perhaps as portionless, as Isabella; and if the heir\nof the Tilney property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself,\nat what point of interest were the demands of his younger brother to\nrest? The very painful reflections to which this thought led could only\nbe dispersed by a dependence on the effect of that particular\npartiality, which, as she was given to understand by his words as well\nas his actions, she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite\nin the General; and by a recollection of some most generous and\ndisinterested sentiments on the subject of money, which she had more\nthan once heard him utter, and which tempted her to think his\ndisposition in such matters misunderstood by his children."

But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney, whenever he\nmade his application, would give his father any just idea of Isabella’s\nconduct, it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay\nthe whole business before him as it really was, enabling the General by\nthat means to form a cool and impartial opinion, and prepare his\nobjections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations. She\nproposed it to him accordingly; but he did not catch at the measure so\neagerly as she had expected. “No,” said he, “my father’s hands need not\nbe strengthened, and Frederick’s confession of folly need not be\nforestalled.

The\nGeneral, meanwhile, though offended every morning by Frederick’s\nremissness in writing, was free from any real anxiety about him, and\nhad no more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland’s time\nat Northanger pass pleasantly. He often expressed his uneasiness on\nthis head, feared the sameness of every day’s society and employments\nwould disgust her with the place, wished the Lady Frasers had been in\nthe country, talked every now and then of having a large party to\ndinner, and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young\ndancing people in the neighbourhood. But then it was such a dead time\nof year, no wild-fowl, no game, and the Lady Frasers were not in the\ncountry. And it all ended, at last, in his telling Henry one morning\nthat when he next went to Woodston, they would take him by surprise\nthere some day or other, and eat their mutton with him. Henry was\ngreatly honoured and very happy, and Catherine was quite delighted with\nthe scheme. “And when do you think, sir, I may look forward to this\npleasure? I must be at Woodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting,\nand shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days.”"

Two\nhours and three quarters will carry us to Woodston, I suppose; we shall\nbe in the carriage by ten; so, about a quarter before one on Wednesday,\nyou may look for us.”"

Catherine was ashamed\nto say how pretty she thought it, as the General seemed to think an\napology necessary for the flatness of the country, and the size of the\nvillage; but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever\nbeen at, and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the\nrank of a cottage, and at all the little chandler’s shops which they\npassed. At the further end of the village, and tolerably disengaged\nfrom the rest of it, stood the parsonage, a new-built substantial stone\nhouse, with its semicircular sweep and green gates; and, as they drove\nup to the door, Henry, with the friends of his solitude, a large\nNewfoundland puppy and two or three terriers, was ready to receive and\nmake much of them."

    "text": "My dearest Catherine,\n    I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight, and\n    have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner. I\n    really am quite ashamed of my idleness; but in this horrid place\n    one can find time for nothing. I have had my pen in my hand to\n    begin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath, but\n    have always been prevented by some silly trifler or other. Pray\n    write to me soon, and direct to my own home. Thank God, we leave\n    this vile place to-morrow. Since you went away, I have had no\n    pleasure in it—the dust is beyond anything; and everybody one cares\n    for is gone. I believe if I could see you I should not mind the\n    rest, for you are dearer to me than anybody can conceive. I am\n    quite uneasy about your dear brother, not having heard from him\n    since he went to Oxford; and am fearful of some misunderstanding.\n    Your kind offices will set all right: he is the only man I ever did\n    or could love, and I trust you will convince him of it. The spring\n    fashions are partly down; and the hats the most frightful you can\n    imagine. I hope you spend your time pleasantly, but am afraid you\n    never think of me. I will not say all that I could of the family\n    you are with, because I would not be ungenerous, or set you against\n    those you esteem; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust,\n    and young men never know their minds two days together. I rejoice\n    to say that the young man whom, of all others, I particularly\n    abhor, has left Bath. You will know, from this description, I must\n    mean Captain Tilney, who, as you may remember, was amazingly\n    disposed to follow and tease me, before you went away. Afterwards\n    he got worse, and became quite my shadow. Many girls might have\n    been taken in, for never were such attentions; but I knew the\n    fickle sex too well. He went away to his regiment two days ago, and\n    I trust I shall never be plagued with him again. He is the greatest\n    coxcomb I ever saw, and amazingly disagreeable. The last two days\n    he was always by the side of Charlotte Davis: I pitied his taste,\n    but took no notice of him. The last time we met was in Bath Street,\n    and I turned directly into a shop that he might not speak to me; I\n    would not even look at him. He went into the pump-room afterwards;\n    but I would not have followed him for all the world. Such a\n    contrast between him and your brother! pray send me some news of\n    the latter—I am quite unhappy about him; he seemed so uncomfortable\n    when he went away, with a cold, or something that affected his\n    spirits. I would write to him myself, but have mislaid his\n    direction; and, as I hinted above, am afraid he took something in\n    my conduct amiss. Pray explain everything to his satisfaction; or,\n    if he still harbours any doubt, a line from himself to me, or a\n    call at Putney when next in town, might set all to rights. I have\n    not been to the Rooms this age, nor to the play, except going in\n    last night with the Hodges, for a frolic, at half price: they\n    teased me into it; and I was determined they should not say I shut\n    myself up because Tilney was gone. We happened to sit by the\n    Mitchells, and they pretended to be quite surprised to see me out.\n    I knew their spite: at one time they could not be civil to me, but\n    now they are all friendship; but I am not such a fool as to be\n    taken in by them. You know I have a pretty good spirit of my own.\n    Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine, as I wore it\n    the week before at the Concert, but made wretched work of it—it\n    happened to become my odd face, I believe, at least Tilney told me\n    so at the time, and said every eye was upon me; but he is the last\n    man whose word I would take. I wear nothing but purple now: I know\n    I look hideous in it, but no matter—it is your dear brother’s\n    favourite colour. Lose no time, my dearest, sweetest Catherine, in\n    writing to him and to me,"

His departure gave\nCatherine the first experimental conviction that a loss may be\nsometimes a gain. The happiness with which their time now passed, every\nemployment voluntary, every laugh indulged, every meal a scene of ease\nand good humour, walking where they liked and when they liked, their\nhours, pleasures, and fatigues at their own command, made her\nthoroughly sensible of the restraint which the General’s presence had\nimposed, and most thankfully feel their present release from it. Such\nease and such delights made her love the place and the people more and\nmore every day; and had it not been for a dread of its soon becoming\nexpedient to leave the one, and an apprehension of not being equally\nbeloved by the other, she would at each moment of each day have been\nperfectly happy; but she was now in the fourth week of her visit;\nbefore the General came home, the fourth week would be turned, and\nperhaps it might seem an intrusion if she stayed much longer. This was\na painful consideration whenever it occurred; and eager to get rid of\nsuch a weight on her mind, she very soon resolved to speak to Eleanor\nabout it at once, propose going away, and be guided in her conduct by\nthe manner in which her proposal might be taken."

Eleanor looked and\ndeclared herself much concerned. She had “hoped for the pleasure of her\ncompany for a much longer time—had been misled (perhaps by her wishes)\nto suppose that a much longer visit had been promised—and could not but\nthink that if Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure it was to\nher to have her there, they would be too generous to hasten her\nreturn.” Catherine explained: “Oh! as to _that_, Papa and Mamma were in\nno hurry at all.

In having this cause of\nuneasiness so pleasantly removed, the force of the other was likewise\nweakened. The kindness, the earnestness of Eleanor’s manner in pressing\nher to stay, and Henry’s gratified look on being told that her stay was\ndetermined, were such sweet proofs of her importance with them, as left\nher only just so much solicitude as the human mind can never do\ncomfortably without. She did—almost always—believe that Henry loved\nher, and quite always that his father and sister loved and even wished\nher to belong to them; and believing so far, her doubts and anxieties\nwere merely sportive irritations."

His loss was not now what it\nhad been while the General was at home; it lessened their gaiety, but\ndid not ruin their comfort; and the two girls agreeing in occupation,\nand improving in intimacy, found themselves so well sufficient for the\ntime to themselves, that it was eleven o’clock, rather a late hour at\nthe abbey, before they quitted the supper-room on the day of Henry’s\ndeparture. They had just reached the head of the stairs when it seemed,\nas far as the thickness of the walls would allow them to judge, that a\ncarriage was driving up to the door, and the next moment confirmed the\nidea by the loud noise of the house-bell.

Scarcely, however,\nhad she convicted her fancy of error, when the noise of something\nmoving close to her door made her start; it seemed as if someone was\ntouching the very doorway—and in another moment a slight motion of the\nlock proved that some hand must be on it. She trembled a little at the\nidea of anyone’s approaching so cautiously; but resolving not to be\nagain overcome by trivial appearances of alarm, or misled by a raised\nimagination, she stepped quietly forward, and opened the door. Eleanor,\nand only Eleanor, stood there. Catherine’s spirits, however, were\ntranquillized but for an instant, for Eleanor’s cheeks were pale, and\nher manner greatly agitated. Though evidently intending to come in, it\nseemed an effort to enter the room, and a still greater to speak when\nthere. Catherine, supposing some uneasiness on Captain Tilney’s\naccount, could only express her concern by silent attention, obliged\nher to be seated, rubbed her temples with lavender water, and hung over\nher with affectionate solicitude. “My dear Catherine, you must not—you\nmust not indeed—” were Eleanor’s first connected words. “I am quite\nwell. This kindness distracts me—I cannot bear it—I come to you on such\nan errand!”"

But the knowledge would have been\nuseless here; it was not called for; neither clemency nor dignity was\nput to the trial—Eleanor brought no message.

It was not four\nand twenty hours ago since they had met there to the same repast, but\nin circumstances how different! with what cheerful ease, what happy,\nthough false, security, had she then looked around her, enjoying\neverything present, and fearing little in future, beyond Henry’s going\nto Woodston for a day! happy, happy breakfast! for Henry had been\nthere; Henry had sat by her and helped her. These reflections were long\nindulged undisturbed by any address from her companion, who sat as deep\nin thought as herself; and the appearance of the carriage was the first\nthing to startle and recall them to the present moment. Catherine’s\ncolour rose at the sight of it; and the indignity with which she was\ntreated, striking at that instant on her mind with peculiar force, made\nher for a short time sensible only of resentment. Eleanor seemed now\nimpelled into resolution and speech."

It had occurred to her that\nafter so long an absence from home, Catherine might not be provided\nwith money enough for the expenses of her journey, and, upon suggesting\nit to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation, it proved to\nbe exactly the case. Catherine had never thought on the subject till\nthat moment, but, upon examining her purse, was convinced that but for\nthis kindness of her friend, she might have been turned from the house\nwithout even the means of getting home; and the distress in which she\nmust have been thereby involved filling the minds of both, scarcely\nanother word was said by either during the time of their remaining\ntogether. Short, however, was that time. The carriage was soon\nannounced to be ready; and Catherine, instantly rising, a long and\naffectionate embrace supplied the place of language in bidding each\nother adieu; and, as they entered the hall, unable to leave the house\nwithout some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by\neither, she paused a moment, and with quivering lips just made it\nintelligible that she left “her kind remembrance for her absent\nfriend.” But with this approach to his name ended all possibility of\nrestraining her feelings; and, hiding her face as well as she could\nwith her handkerchief, she darted across the hall, jumped into the\nchaise, and in a moment was driven from the door."

Unfortunately, the road she now\ntravelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily\npassed along in going to and from Woodston; and, for fourteen miles,\nevery bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects\non which she had first looked under impressions so different. Every\nmile, as it brought her nearer Woodston, added to her sufferings, and\nwhen within the distance of five, she passed the turning which led to\nit, and thought of Henry, so near, yet so unconscious, her grief and\nagitation were excessive."

From this, she was preserved too by\nanother cause, by feeling no eagerness for her journey’s conclusion;\nfor to return in such a manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the\npleasure of a meeting with those she loved best, even after an absence\nsuch as hers—an eleven weeks’ absence. What had she to say that would\nnot humble herself and pain her family, that would not increase her own\ngrief by the confession of it, extend an useless resentment, and\nperhaps involve the innocent with the guilty in undistinguishing ill\nwill? She could never do justice to Henry and Eleanor’s merit; she felt\nit too strongly for expression; and should a dislike be taken against\nthem, should they be thought of unfavourably, on their father’s\naccount, it would cut her to the heart."

They were far from being an irritable race; far from any\nquickness in catching, or bitterness in resenting, affronts: but here,\nwhen the whole was unfolded, was an insult not to be overlooked, nor,\nfor the first half hour, to be easily pardoned. Without suffering any\nromantic alarm, in the consideration of their daughter’s long and\nlonely journey, Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might\nhave been productive of much unpleasantness to her; that it was what\nthey could never have voluntarily suffered; and that, in forcing her on\nsuch a measure, General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor\nfeelingly—neither as a gentleman nor as a parent. Why he had done it,\nwhat could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality, and so\nsuddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual\nill will, was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as\nCatherine herself; but it did not oppress them by any means so long;\nand, after a due course of useless conjecture, that “it was a strange\nbusiness, and that he must be a very strange man,” grew enough for all\ntheir indignation and wonder; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the\nsweets of incomprehensibility, exclaiming and conjecturing with\nyouthful ardour. “My dear, you give yourself a great deal of needless\ntrouble,” said her mother at last; “depend upon it, it is something not\nat all worth understanding.”"

Mrs. Morland watched the progress of this relapse; and seeing,\nin her daughter’s absent and dissatisfied look, the full proof of that\nrepining spirit to which she had now begun to attribute her want of\ncheerfulness, hastily left the room to fetch the book in question,\nanxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady.

With a look of much respect,\nhe immediately rose, and being introduced to her by her conscious\ndaughter as “Mr. Henry Tilney,” with the embarrassment of real\nsensibility began to apologize for his appearance there, acknowledging\nthat after what had passed he had little right to expect a welcome at\nFullerton, and stating his impatience to be assured of Miss Morland’s\nhaving reached her home in safety, as the cause of his intrusion. He\ndid not address himself to an uncandid judge or a resentful heart. Far\nfrom comprehending him or his sister in their father’s misconduct, Mrs.\nMorland had been always kindly disposed towards each, and instantly,\npleased by his appearance, received him with the simple professions of\nunaffected benevolence; thanking him for such an attention to her\ndaughter, assuring him that the friends of her children were always\nwelcome there, and entreating him to say not another word of the past."

After a couple of minutes’ unbroken\nsilence, Henry, turning to Catherine for the first time since her\nmother’s entrance, asked her, with sudden alacrity, if Mr. and Mrs.\nAllen were now at Fullerton? And on developing, from amidst all her\nperplexity of words in reply, the meaning, which one short syllable\nwould have given, immediately expressed his intention of paying his\nrespects to them, and, with a rising colour, asked her if she would\nhave the goodness to show him the way. “You may see the house from this\nwindow, sir,” was information on Sarah’s side, which produced only a\nbow of acknowledgment from the gentleman, and a silencing nod from her\nmother; for Mrs. Morland, thinking it probable, as a secondary\nconsideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours, that\nhe might have some explanation to give of his father’s behaviour, which\nit must be more pleasant for him to communicate only to Catherine,\nwould not on any account prevent her accompanying him. They began their\nwalk, and Mrs. Morland was not entirely mistaken in his object in\nwishing it. Some explanation on his father’s account he had to give;\nbut his first purpose was to explain himself, and before they reached\nMr. Allen’s grounds he had done it so well that Catherine did not think\nit could ever be repeated too often. She was assured of his affection;\nand that heart in return was solicited, which, perhaps, they pretty\nequally knew was already entirely his own; for, though Henry was now\nsincerely attached to her, though he felt and delighted in all the\nexcellencies of her character and truly loved her society, I must\nconfess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude,\nor, in other words, that a persuasion of her partiality for him had\nbeen the only cause of giving her a serious thought. It is a new\ncircumstance in romance, I acknowledge, and dreadfully derogatory of an\nheroine’s dignity; but if it be as new in common life, the credit of a\nwild imagination will at least be all my own."

    "text": "John Thorpe had first misled him. The General, perceiving his son one\nnight at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss\nMorland, had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he knew more of her\nthan her name. Thorpe, most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of\nGeneral Tilney’s importance, had been joyfully and proudly\ncommunicative; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of\nMorland’s engaging Isabella, but likewise pretty well resolved upon\nmarrying Catherine himself, his vanity induced him to represent the\nfamily as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him\nbelieve them. With whomsoever he was, or was likely to be connected,\nhis own consequence always required that theirs should be great, and as\nhis intimacy with any acquaintance grew, so regularly grew their\nfortune. The expectations of his friend Morland, therefore, from the\nfirst overrated, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been\ngradually increasing; and by merely adding twice as much for the\ngrandeur of the moment, by doubling what he chose to think the amount\nof Mr. Morland’s preferment, trebling his private fortune, bestowing a\nrich aunt, and sinking half the children, he was able to represent the\nwhole family to the General in a most respectable light. For Catherine,\nhowever, the peculiar object of the General’s curiosity, and his own\nspeculations, he had yet something more in reserve, and the ten or\nfifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a\npretty addition to Mr. Allen’s estate. Her intimacy there had made him\nseriously determine on her being handsomely legacied hereafter; and to\nspeak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of\nFullerton naturally followed. Upon such intelligence the General had\nproceeded; for never had it occurred to him to doubt its authority.\nThorpe’s interest in the family, by his sister’s approaching connection\nwith one of its members, and his own views on another (circumstances of\nwhich he boasted with almost equal openness), seemed sufficient\nvouchers for his truth; and to these were added the absolute facts of\nthe Allens being wealthy and childless, of Miss Morland’s being under\ntheir care, and—as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge—of\ntheir treating her with parental kindness. His resolution was soon\nformed. Already had he discerned a liking towards Miss Morland in the\ncountenance of his son; and thankful for Mr. Thorpe’s communication, he\nalmost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted\ninterest and ruining his dearest hopes. Catherine herself could not be\nmore ignorant at the time of all this, than his own children. Henry and\nEleanor, perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their\nfather’s particular respect, had seen with astonishment the suddenness,\ncontinuance, and extent of his attention; and though latterly, from\nsome hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son\nof doing everything in his power to attach her, Henry was convinced of\nhis father’s believing it to be an advantageous connection, it was not\ntill the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea\nof the false calculations which had hurried him on. That they were\nfalse, the General had learnt from the very person who had suggested\nthem, from Thorpe himself, whom he had chanced to meet again in town,\nand who, under the influence of exactly opposite feelings, irritated by\nCatherine’s refusal, and yet more by the failure of a very recent\nendeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella,\nconvinced that they were separated forever, and spurning a friendship\nwhich could be no longer serviceable, hastened to contradict all that\nhe had said before to the advantage of the Morlands—confessed himself\nto have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and\ncharacter, misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his\nfather a man of substance and credit, whereas the transactions of the\ntwo or three last weeks proved him to be neither; for after coming\neagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the\nfamilies, with the most liberal proposals, he had, on being brought to\nthe point by the shrewdness of the relator, been constrained to\nacknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent\nsupport. They were, in fact, a necessitous family; numerous, too,\nalmost beyond example; by no means respected in their own\nneighbourhood, as he had lately had particular opportunities of\ndiscovering; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not\nwarrant; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections; a\nforward, bragging, scheming race."

The means by which\ntheir early marriage was effected can be the only doubt: what probable\ncircumstance could work upon a temper like the General’s? The\ncircumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter\nwith a man of fortune and consequence, which took place in the course\nof the summer—an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good\nhumour, from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained\nhis forgiveness of Henry, and his permission for him “to be a fool if\nhe liked it!”"

    "text": "The marriage of Eleanor Tilney, her removal from all the evils of such\na home as Northanger had been made by Henry’s banishment, to the home\nof her choice and the man of her choice, is an event which I expect to\ngive general satisfaction among all her acquaintance. My own joy on the\noccasion is very sincere. I know no one more entitled, by unpretending\nmerit, or better prepared by habitual suffering, to receive and enjoy\nfelicity. Her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin;\nand he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from\naddressing her. His unexpected accession to title and fortune had\nremoved all his difficulties; and never had the General loved his\ndaughter so well in all her hours of companionship, utility, and\npatient endurance as when he first hailed her “Your Ladyship!” Her\nhusband was really deserving of her; independent of his peerage, his\nwealth, and his attachment, being to a precision the most charming\nyoung man in the world. Any further definition of his merits must be\nunnecessary; the most charming young man in the world is instantly\nbefore the imagination of us all. Concerning the one in question,\ntherefore, I have only to add—aware that the rules of composition\nforbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable—that\nthis was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him\nthat collection of washing-bills, resulting from a long visit at\nNorthanger, by which my heroine was involved in one of her most\nalarming adventures."

    "text": "The influence of the Viscount and Viscountess in their brother’s behalf\nwas assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland’s circumstances\nwhich, as soon as the General would allow himself to be informed, they\nwere qualified to give. It taught him that he had been scarcely more\nmisled by Thorpe’s first boast of the family wealth than by his\nsubsequent malicious overthrow of it; that in no sense of the word were\nthey necessitous or poor, and that Catherine would have three thousand\npounds. This was so material an amendment of his late expectations that\nit greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride; and by no\nmeans without its effect was the private intelligence, which he was at\nsome pains to procure, that the Fullerton estate, being entirely at the\ndisposal of its present proprietor, was consequently open to every\ngreedy speculation."

    "text": "On the strength of this, the General, soon after Eleanor’s marriage,\npermitted his son to return to Northanger, and thence made him the\nbearer of his consent, very courteously worded in a page full of empty\nprofessions to Mr. Morland. The event which it authorized soon\nfollowed: Henry and Catherine were married, the bells rang, and\neverybody smiled; and, as this took place within a twelvemonth from the\nfirst day of their meeting, it will not appear, after all the dreadful\ndelays occasioned by the General’s cruelty, that they were essentially\nhurt by it. To begin perfect happiness at the respective ages of\ntwenty-six and eighteen is to do pretty well; and professing myself\nmoreover convinced that the General’s unjust interference, so far from\nbeing really injurious to their felicity, was perhaps rather conducive\nto it, by improving their knowledge of each other, and adding strength\nto their attachment, I leave it to be settled, by whomsoever it may\nconcern, whether the tendency of this work be altogether to recommend\nparental tyranny, or reward filial disobedience."

    "text": "Northanger Abbey was written in 1797–98 under a different title. The\nmanuscript was revised around 1803 and sold to a London publisher,\nCrosbie & Co., who sold it back in 1816. The Signet Classic text is\nbased on the first edition, published by John Murray, London, in\n1818—the year following Miss Austen’s death. Spelling and punctuation\nhave been largely brought into conformity with modern British usage."
