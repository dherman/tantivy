      "text": "_Lady Susan Vernon to Mr. Vernon._\n\n\nLangford, Dec.\n\n\nMY DEAR BROTHER,—I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of\nprofiting by your kind invitation when we last parted of spending some\nweeks with you at Churchhill, and, therefore, if quite convenient to\nyou and Mrs. Vernon to receive me at present, I shall hope within a few\ndays to be introduced to a sister whom I have so long desired to be\nacquainted with. My kind friends here are most affectionately urgent\nwith me to prolong my stay, but their hospitable and cheerful\ndispositions lead them too much into society for my present situation\nand state of mind; and I impatiently look forward to the hour when I\nshall be admitted into your delightful retirement.\n\nI long to be made known to your dear little children, in whose hearts I\nshall be very eager to secure an interest. I shall soon have need for\nall my fortitude, as I am on the point of separation from my own\ndaughter. The long illness of her dear father prevented my paying her\nthat attention which duty and affection equally dictated, and I have\ntoo much reason to fear that the governess to whose care I consigned\nher was unequal to the charge. I have therefore resolved on placing her\nat one of the best private schools in town, where I shall have an\nopportunity of leaving her myself in my way to you. I am determined,\nyou see, not to be denied admittance at Churchhill. It would indeed\ngive me most painful sensations to know that it were not in your power\nto receive me.\n\nYour most obliged and affectionate sister,\nS. VERNON."

      "text": "_Lady Susan Vernon to Mrs. Johnson._\n\n\nLangford.\n\n\nYou were mistaken, my dear Alicia, in supposing me fixed at this place\nfor the rest of the winter: it grieves me to say how greatly you were\nmistaken, for I have seldom spent three months more agreeably than\nthose which have just flown away. At present, nothing goes smoothly;\nthe females of the family are united against me. You foretold how it\nwould be when I first came to Langford, and Mainwaring is so uncommonly\npleasing that I was not without apprehensions for myself. I remember\nsaying to myself, as I drove to the house, “I like this man, pray\nHeaven no harm come of it!” But I was determined to be discreet, to\nbear in mind my being only four months a widow, and to be as quiet as\npossible: and I have been so, my dear creature; I have admitted no\none’s attentions but Mainwaring’s. I have avoided all general\nflirtation whatever; I have distinguished no creature besides, of all\nthe numbers resorting hither, except Sir James Martin, on whom I\nbestowed a little notice, in order to detach him from Miss Mainwaring;\nbut, if the world could know my motive _there_ they would honour me. I\nhave been called an unkind mother, but it was the sacred impulse of\nmaternal affection, it was the advantage of my daughter that led me on;\nand if that daughter were not the greatest simpleton on earth, I might\nhave been rewarded for my exertions as I ought.\n\nSir James did make proposals to me for Frederica; but Frederica, who\nwas born to be the torment of my life, chose to set herself so\nviolently against the match that I thought it better to lay aside the\nscheme for the present. I have more than once repented that I did not\nmarry him myself; and were he but one degree less contemptibly weak I\ncertainly should: but I must own myself rather romantic in that\nrespect, and that riches only will not satisfy me. The event of all\nthis is very provoking: Sir James is gone, Maria highly incensed, and\nMrs. Mainwaring insupportably jealous; so jealous, in short, and so\nenraged against me, that, in the fury of her temper, I should not be\nsurprized at her appealing to her guardian, if she had the liberty of\naddressing him: but there your husband stands my friend; and the\nkindest, most amiable action of his life was his throwing her off for\never on her marriage. Keep up his resentment, therefore, I charge you.\nWe are now in a sad state; no house was ever more altered; the whole\nparty are at war, and Mainwaring scarcely dares speak to me. It is time\nfor me to be gone; I have therefore determined on leaving them, and\nshall spend, I hope, a comfortable day with you in town within this\nweek. If I am as little in favour with Mr. Johnson as ever, you must\ncome to me at 10 Wigmore street; but I hope this may not be the case,\nfor as Mr. Johnson, with all his faults, is a man to whom that great\nword “respectable” is always given, and I am known to be so intimate\nwith his wife, his slighting me has an awkward look.\n\nI take London in my way to that insupportable spot, a country village;\nfor I am really going to Churchhill. Forgive me, my dear friend, it is\nmy last resource. Were there another place in England open to me I\nwould prefer it. Charles Vernon is my aversion; and I am afraid of his\nwife. At Churchhill, however, I must remain till I have something\nbetter in view. My young lady accompanies me to town, where I shall\ndeposit her under the care of Miss Summers, in Wigmore street, till she\nbecomes a little more reasonable. She will made good connections there,\nas the girls are all of the best families. The price is immense, and\nmuch beyond what I can ever attempt to pay.\n\nAdieu, I will send you a line as soon as I arrive in town.\n\nYours ever,\nS. VERNON."

      "text": "_Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy._\n\n\nChurchhill.\n\n\nMy dear Mother,—I am very sorry to tell you that it will not be in our\npower to keep our promise of spending our Christmas with you; and we\nare prevented that happiness by a circumstance which is not likely to\nmake us any amends. Lady Susan, in a letter to her brother-in-law, has\ndeclared her intention of visiting us almost immediately; and as such a\nvisit is in all probability merely an affair of convenience, it is\nimpossible to conjecture its length. I was by no means prepared for\nsuch an event, nor can I now account for her ladyship’s conduct;\nLangford appeared so exactly the place for her in every respect, as\nwell from the elegant and expensive style of living there, as from her\nparticular attachment to Mr. Mainwaring, that I was very far from\nexpecting so speedy a distinction, though I always imagined from her\nincreasing friendship for us since her husband’s death that we should,\nat some future period, be obliged to receive her. Mr. Vernon, I think,\nwas a great deal too kind to her when he was in Staffordshire; her\nbehaviour to him, independent of her general character, has been so\ninexcusably artful and ungenerous since our marriage was first in\nagitation that no one less amiable and mild than himself could have\noverlooked it all; and though, as his brother’s widow, and in narrow\ncircumstances, it was proper to render her pecuniary assistance, I\ncannot help thinking his pressing invitation to her to visit us at\nChurchhill perfectly unnecessary. Disposed, however, as he always is to\nthink the best of everyone, her display of grief, and professions of\nregret, and general resolutions of prudence, were sufficient to soften\nhis heart and make him really confide in her sincerity; but, as for\nmyself, I am still unconvinced, and plausibly as her ladyship has now\nwritten, I cannot make up my mind till I better understand her real\nmeaning in coming to us. You may guess, therefore, my dear madam, with\nwhat feelings I look forward to her arrival. She will have occasion for\nall those attractive powers for which she is celebrated to gain any\nshare of my regard; and I shall certainly endeavour to guard myself\nagainst their influence, if not accompanied by something more\nsubstantial. She expresses a most eager desire of being acquainted with\nme, and makes very gracious mention of my children but I am not quite\nweak enough to suppose a woman who has behaved with inattention, if not\nwith unkindness, to her own child, should be attached to any of mine.\nMiss Vernon is to be placed at a school in London before her mother\ncomes to us which I am glad of, for her sake and my own. It must be to\nher advantage to be separated from her mother, and a girl of sixteen\nwho has received so wretched an education, could not be a very\ndesirable companion here. Reginald has long wished, I know, to see the\ncaptivating Lady Susan, and we shall depend on his joining our party\nsoon. I am glad to hear that my father continues so well; and am, with\nbest love, &c.,\n\nCATHERINE VERNON."

      "text": "_Mr. De Courcy to Mrs. Vernon._\n\n\nParklands.\n\n\nMy dear Sister,—I congratulate you and Mr. Vernon on being about to\nreceive into your family the most accomplished coquette in England. As\na very distinguished flirt I have always been taught to consider her,\nbut it has lately fallen in my way to hear some particulars of her\nconduct at Langford: which prove that she does not confine herself to\nthat sort of honest flirtation which satisfies most people, but aspires\nto the more delicious gratification of making a whole family miserable.\nBy her behaviour to Mr. Mainwaring she gave jealousy and wretchedness\nto his wife, and by her attentions to a young man previously attached\nto Mr. Mainwaring’s sister deprived an amiable girl of her lover.\n\nI learnt all this from Mr. Smith, now in this neighbourhood (I have\ndined with him, at Hurst and Wilford), who is just come from Langford\nwhere he was a fortnight with her ladyship, and who is therefore well\nqualified to make the communication.\n\nWhat a woman she must be! I long to see her, and shall certainly accept\nyour kind invitation, that I may form some idea of those bewitching\npowers which can do so much—engaging at the same time, and in the same\nhouse, the affections of two men, who were neither of them at liberty\nto bestow them—and all this without the charm of youth! I am glad to\nfind Miss Vernon does not accompany her mother to Churchhill, as she\nhas not even manners to recommend her; and, according to Mr. Smith’s\naccount, is equally dull and proud. Where pride and stupidity unite\nthere can be no dissimulation worthy notice, and Miss Vernon shall be\nconsigned to unrelenting contempt; but by all that I can gather Lady\nSusan possesses a degree of captivating deceit which it must be\npleasing to witness and detect. I shall be with you very soon, and am\never,\n\nYour affectionate brother,\nR. DE COURCY."

      "text": "_Lady Susan Vernon to Mrs. Johnson._\n\n\nChurchhill.\n\n\nI received your note, my dear Alicia, just before I left town, and\nrejoice to be assured that Mr. Johnson suspected nothing of your\nengagement the evening before. It is undoubtedly better to deceive him\nentirely, and since he will be stubborn he must be tricked. I arrived\nhere in safety, and have no reason to complain of my reception from Mr.\nVernon; but I confess myself not equally satisfied with the behaviour\nof his lady. She is perfectly well-bred, indeed, and has the air of a\nwoman of fashion, but her manners are not such as can persuade me of\nher being prepossessed in my favour. I wanted her to be delighted at\nseeing me. I was as amiable as possible on the occasion, but all in\nvain. She does not like me. To be sure, when we consider that I _did_\ntake some pains to prevent my brother-in-law’s marrying her, this want\nof cordiality is not very surprizing, and yet it shows an illiberal and\nvindictive spirit to resent a project which influenced me six years\nago, and which never succeeded at last.\n\nI am sometimes disposed to repent that I did not let Charles buy Vernon\nCastle, when we were obliged to sell it; but it was a trying\ncircumstance, especially as the sale took place exactly at the time of\nhis marriage; and everybody ought to respect the delicacy of those\nfeelings which could not endure that my husband’s dignity should be\nlessened by his younger brother’s having possession of the family\nestate. Could matters have been so arranged as to prevent the necessity\nof our leaving the castle, could we have lived with Charles and kept\nhim single, I should have been very far from persuading my husband to\ndispose of it elsewhere; but Charles was on the point of marrying Miss\nDe Courcy, and the event has justified me. Here are children in\nabundance, and what benefit could have accrued to me from his\npurchasing Vernon? My having prevented it may perhaps have given his\nwife an unfavourable impression, but where there is a disposition to\ndislike, a motive will never be wanting; and as to money matters it has\nnot withheld him from being very useful to me. I really have a regard\nfor him, he is so easily imposed upon! The house is a good one, the\nfurniture fashionable, and everything announces plenty and elegance.\nCharles is very rich I am sure; when a man has once got his name in a\nbanking-house he rolls in money; but they do not know what to do with\nit, keep very little company, and never go to London but on business.\nWe shall be as stupid as possible. I mean to win my sister-in-law’s\nheart through the children; I know all their names already, and am\ngoing to attach myself with the greatest sensibility to one in\nparticular, a young Frederic, whom I take on my lap and sigh over for\nhis dear uncle’s sake.\n\nPoor Mainwaring! I need not tell you how much I miss him, how\nperpetually he is in my thoughts. I found a dismal letter from him on\nmy arrival here, full of complaints of his wife and sister, and\nlamentations on the cruelty of his fate. I passed off the letter as his\nwife’s, to the Vernons, and when I write to him it must be under cover\nto you.\n\nEver yours,\nS. VERNON."

      "text": "_Mrs. Vernon to Mr. De Courcy._\n\n\nChurchhill.\n\n\nWell, my dear Reginald, I have seen this dangerous creature, and must\ngive you some description of her, though I hope you will soon be able\nto form your own judgment. She is really excessively pretty; however\nyou may choose to question the allurements of a lady no longer young, I\nmust, for my own part, declare that I have seldom seen so lovely a\nwoman as Lady Susan. She is delicately fair, with fine grey eyes and\ndark eyelashes; and from her appearance one would not suppose her more\nthan five and twenty, though she must in fact be ten years older. I was\ncertainly not disposed to admire her, though always hearing she was\nbeautiful; but I cannot help feeling that she possesses an uncommon\nunion of symmetry, brilliancy, and grace. Her address to me was so\ngentle, frank, and even affectionate, that, if I had not known how much\nshe has always disliked me for marrying Mr. Vernon, and that we had\nnever met before, I should have imagined her an attached friend. One is\napt, I believe, to connect assurance of manner with coquetry, and to\nexpect that an impudent address will naturally attend an impudent mind;\nat least I was myself prepared for an improper degree of confidence in\nLady Susan; but her countenance is absolutely sweet, and her voice and\nmanner winningly mild. I am sorry it is so, for what is this but\ndeceit? Unfortunately, one knows her too well. She is clever and\nagreeable, has all that knowledge of the world which makes conversation\neasy, and talks very well, with a happy command of language, which is\ntoo often used, I believe, to make black appear white. She has already\nalmost persuaded me of her being warmly attached to her daughter,\nthough I have been so long convinced to the contrary. She speaks of her\nwith so much tenderness and anxiety, lamenting so bitterly the neglect\nof her education, which she represents however as wholly unavoidable,\nthat I am forced to recollect how many successive springs her ladyship\nspent in town, while her daughter was left in Staffordshire to the care\nof servants, or a governess very little better, to prevent my believing\nwhat she says.\n\nIf her manners have so great an influence on my resentful heart, you\nmay judge how much more strongly they operate on Mr. Vernon’s generous\ntemper. I wish I could be as well satisfied as he is, that it was\nreally her choice to leave Langford for Churchhill; and if she had not\nstayed there for months before she discovered that her friend’s manner\nof living did not suit her situation or feelings, I might have believed\nthat concern for the loss of such a husband as Mr. Vernon, to whom her\nown behaviour was far from unexceptionable, might for a time make her\nwish for retirement. But I cannot forget the length of her visit to the\nMainwarings, and when I reflect on the different mode of life which she\nled with them from that to which she must now submit, I can only\nsuppose that the wish of establishing her reputation by following\nthough late the path of propriety, occasioned her removal from a family\nwhere she must in reality have been particularly happy. Your friend Mr.\nSmith’s story, however, cannot be quite correct, as she corresponds\nregularly with Mrs. Mainwaring. At any rate it must be exaggerated. It\nis scarcely possible that two men should be so grossly deceived by her\nat once.\n\nYours, &c.,\nCATHERINE VERNON"

      "text": "_Lady Susan Vernon to Mrs. Johnson._\n\n\nChurchhill.\n\n\nMy dear Alicia,—You are very good in taking notice of Frederica, and I\nam grateful for it as a mark of your friendship; but as I cannot have\nany doubt of the warmth of your affection, I am far from exacting so\nheavy a sacrifice. She is a stupid girl, and has nothing to recommend\nher. I would not, therefore, on my account, have you encumber one\nmoment of your precious time by sending for her to Edward Street,\nespecially as every visit is so much deducted from the grand affair of\neducation, which I really wish to have attended to while she remains at\nMiss Summers’s. I want her to play and sing with some portion of taste\nand a good deal of assurance, as she has my hand and arm and a\ntolerable voice. I was so much indulged in my infant years that I was\nnever obliged to attend to anything, and consequently am without the\naccomplishments which are now necessary to finish a pretty woman. Not\nthat I am an advocate for the prevailing fashion of acquiring a perfect\nknowledge of all languages, arts, and sciences. It is throwing time\naway to be mistress of French, Italian, and German: music, singing, and\ndrawing, &c., will gain a woman some applause, but will not add one\nlover to her list—grace and manner, after all, are of the greatest\nimportance. I do not mean, therefore, that Frederica’s acquirements\nshould be more than superficial, and I flatter myself that she will not\nremain long enough at school to understand anything thoroughly. I hope\nto see her the wife of Sir James within a twelvemonth. You know on what\nI ground my hope, and it is certainly a good foundation, for school\nmust be very humiliating to a girl of Frederica’s age. And, by-the-by,\nyou had better not invite her any more on that account, as I wish her\nto find her situation as unpleasant as possible. I am sure of Sir James\nat any time, and could make him renew his application by a line. I\nshall trouble you meanwhile to prevent his forming any other attachment\nwhen he comes to town. Ask him to your house occasionally, and talk to\nhim of Frederica, that he may not forget her. Upon the whole, I commend\nmy own conduct in this affair extremely, and regard it as a very happy\ninstance of circumspection and tenderness. Some mothers would have\ninsisted on their daughter’s accepting so good an offer on the first\noverture; but I could not reconcile it to myself to force Frederica\ninto a marriage from which her heart revolted, and instead of adopting\nso harsh a measure merely propose to make it her own choice, by\nrendering her thoroughly uncomfortable till she does accept him—but\nenough of this tiresome girl. You may well wonder how I contrive to\npass my time here, and for the first week it was insufferably dull.\nNow, however, we begin to mend, our party is enlarged by Mrs. Vernon’s\nbrother, a handsome young man, who promises me some amusement. There is\nsomething about him which rather interests me, a sort of sauciness and\nfamiliarity which I shall teach him to correct. He is lively, and seems\nclever, and when I have inspired him with greater respect for me than\nhis sister’s kind offices have implanted, he may be an agreeable flirt.\nThere is exquisite pleasure in subduing an insolent spirit, in making a\nperson predetermined to dislike acknowledge one’s superiority. I have\ndisconcerted him already by my calm reserve, and it shall be my\nendeavour to humble the pride of these self important De Courcys still\nlower, to convince Mrs. Vernon that her sisterly cautions have been\nbestowed in vain, and to persuade Reginald that she has scandalously\nbelied me. This project will serve at least to amuse me, and prevent my\nfeeling so acutely this dreadful separation from you and all whom I\nlove.\n\nYours ever,\nS. VERNON."

      "text": "_Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy._\n\n\nChurchhill.\n\n\nMy dear Mother,—You must not expect Reginald back again for some time.\nHe desires me to tell you that the present open weather induces him to\naccept Mr. Vernon’s invitation to prolong his stay in Sussex, that they\nmay have some hunting together. He means to send for his horses\nimmediately, and it is impossible to say when you may see him in Kent.\nI will not disguise my sentiments on this change from you, my dear\nmother, though I think you had better not communicate them to my\nfather, whose excessive anxiety about Reginald would subject him to an\nalarm which might seriously affect his health and spirits. Lady Susan\nhas certainly contrived, in the space of a fortnight, to make my\nbrother like her. In short, I am persuaded that his continuing here\nbeyond the time originally fixed for his return is occasioned as much\nby a degree of fascination towards her, as by the wish of hunting with\nMr. Vernon, and of course I cannot receive that pleasure from the\nlength of his visit which my brother’s company would otherwise give me.\nI am, indeed, provoked at the artifice of this unprincipled woman; what\nstronger proof of her dangerous abilities can be given than this\nperversion of Reginald’s judgment, which when he entered the house was\nso decidedly against her! In his last letter he actually gave me some\nparticulars of her behaviour at Langford, such as he received from a\ngentleman who knew her perfectly well, which, if true, must raise\nabhorrence against her, and which Reginald himself was entirely\ndisposed to credit. His opinion of her, I am sure, was as low as of any\nwoman in England; and when he first came it was evident that he\nconsidered her as one entitled neither to delicacy nor respect, and\nthat he felt she would be delighted with the attentions of any man\ninclined to flirt with her. Her behaviour, I confess, has been\ncalculated to do away with such an idea; I have not detected the\nsmallest impropriety in it—nothing of vanity, of pretension, of levity;\nand she is altogether so attractive that I should not wonder at his\nbeing delighted with her, had he known nothing of her previous to this\npersonal acquaintance; but, against reason, against conviction, to be\nso well pleased with her, as I am sure he is, does really astonish me.\nHis admiration was at first very strong, but no more than was natural,\nand I did not wonder at his being much struck by the gentleness and\ndelicacy of her manners; but when he has mentioned her of late it has\nbeen in terms of more extraordinary praise; and yesterday he actually\nsaid that he could not be surprised at any effect produced on the heart\nof man by such loveliness and such abilities; and when I lamented, in\nreply, the badness of her disposition, he observed that whatever might\nhave been her errors they were to be imputed to her neglected education\nand early marriage, and that she was altogether a wonderful woman. This\ntendency to excuse her conduct or to forget it, in the warmth of\nadmiration, vexes me; and if I did not know that Reginald is too much\nat home at Churchhill to need an invitation for lengthening his visit,\nI should regret Mr. Vernon’s giving him any. Lady Susan’s intentions\nare of course those of absolute coquetry, or a desire of universal\nadmiration; I cannot for a moment imagine that she has anything more\nserious in view; but it mortifies me to see a young man of Reginald’s\nsense duped by her at all.\n\nI am, &c.,\nCATHERINE VERNON."

Sir Reginald is very\ninfirm, and not likely to stand in your way long. I hear the young man\nwell spoken of; and though no one can really deserve you, my dearest\nSusan, Mr. De Courcy may be worth having. Mainwaring will storm of\ncourse, but you easily pacify him; besides, the most scrupulous point\nof honour could not require you to wait for _his_ emancipation. I have\nseen Sir James; he came to town for a few days last week, and called\nseveral times in Edward Street. I talked to him about you and your\ndaughter, and he is so far from having forgotten you, that I am sure he\nwould marry either of you with pleasure. I gave him hopes of\nFrederica’s relenting, and told him a great deal of her improvements. I\nscolded him for making love to Maria Mainwaring; he protested that he\nhad been only in joke, and we both laughed heartily at her\ndisappointment; and, in short, were very agreeable.

      "text": "_Lady Susan Vernon to Mrs. Johnson._\n\n\nChurchhill.\n\n\nI am much obliged to you, my dear Friend, for your advice respecting\nMr. De Courcy, which I know was given with the full conviction of its\nexpediency, though I am not quite determined on following it. I cannot\neasily resolve on anything so serious as marriage; especially as I am\nnot at present in want of money, and might perhaps, till the old\ngentleman’s death, be very little benefited by the match. It is true\nthat I am vain enough to believe it within my reach. I have made him\nsensible of my power, and can now enjoy the pleasure of triumphing over\na mind prepared to dislike me, and prejudiced against all my past\nactions. His sister, too, is, I hope, convinced how little the\nungenerous representations of anyone to the disadvantage of another\nwill avail when opposed by the immediate influence of intellect and\nmanner. I see plainly that she is uneasy at my progress in the good\nopinion of her brother, and conclude that nothing will be wanting on\nher part to counteract me; but having once made him doubt the justice\nof her opinion of me, I think I may defy her. It has been delightful to\nme to watch his advances towards intimacy, especially to observe his\naltered manner in consequence of my repressing by the cool dignity of\nmy deportment his insolent approach to direct familiarity. My conduct\nhas been equally guarded from the first, and I never behaved less like\na coquette in the whole course of my life, though perhaps my desire of\ndominion was never more decided. I have subdued him entirely by\nsentiment and serious conversation, and made him, I may venture to say,\nat least half in love with me, without the semblance of the most\ncommonplace flirtation. Mrs. Vernon’s consciousness of deserving every\nsort of revenge that it can be in my power to inflict for her\nill-offices could alone enable her to perceive that I am actuated by\nany design in behaviour so gentle and unpretending. Let her think and\nact as she chooses, however. I have never yet found that the advice of\na sister could prevent a young man’s being in love if he chose. We are\nadvancing now to some kind of confidence, and in short are likely to be\nengaged in a sort of platonic friendship. On my side you may be sure of\nits never being more, for if I were not attached to another person as\nmuch as I can be to anyone, I should make a point of not bestowing my\naffection on a man who had dared to think so meanly of me. Reginald has\na good figure and is not unworthy the praise you have heard given him,\nbut is still greatly inferior to our friend at Langford. He is less\npolished, less insinuating than Mainwaring, and is comparatively\ndeficient in the power of saying those delightful things which put one\nin good humour with oneself and all the world. He is quite agreeable\nenough, however, to afford me amusement, and to make many of those\nhours pass very pleasantly which would otherwise be spent in\nendeavouring to overcome my sister-in-law’s reserve, and listening to\nthe insipid talk of her husband. Your account of Sir James is most\nsatisfactory, and I mean to give Miss Frederica a hint of my intentions\nvery soon.\n\nYours, &c.,\nS. VERNON."

      "text": "_Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy._\n\n\nChurchhill\n\n\nI really grow quite uneasy, my dearest mother, about Reginald, from\nwitnessing the very rapid increase of Lady Susan’s influence. They are\nnow on terms of the most particular friendship, frequently engaged in\nlong conversations together; and she has contrived by the most artful\ncoquetry to subdue his judgment to her own purposes. It is impossible\nto see the intimacy between them so very soon established without some\nalarm, though I can hardly suppose that Lady Susan’s plans extend to\nmarriage. I wish you could get Reginald home again on any plausible\npretence; he is not at all disposed to leave us, and I have given him\nas many hints of my father’s precarious state of health as common\ndecency will allow me to do in my own house. Her power over him must\nnow be boundless, as she has entirely effaced all his former\nill-opinion, and persuaded him not merely to forget but to justify her\nconduct. Mr. Smith’s account of her proceedings at Langford, where he\naccused her of having made Mr. Mainwaring and a young man engaged to\nMiss Mainwaring distractedly in love with her, which Reginald firmly\nbelieved when he came here, is now, he is persuaded, only a scandalous\ninvention. He has told me so with a warmth of manner which spoke his\nregret at having believed the contrary himself. How sincerely do I\ngrieve that she ever entered this house! I always looked forward to her\ncoming with uneasiness; but very far was it from originating in anxiety\nfor Reginald. I expected a most disagreeable companion for myself, but\ncould not imagine that my brother would be in the smallest danger of\nbeing captivated by a woman with whose principles he was so well\nacquainted, and whose character he so heartily despised. If you can get\nhim away it will be a good thing.\n\nYours, &c.,\nCATHERINE VERNON."

      "text": "_Sir Reginald De Courcy to his Son._\n\n\nParklands.\n\n\nI know that young men in general do not admit of any enquiry even from\ntheir nearest relations into affairs of the heart, but I hope, my dear\nReginald, that you will be superior to such as allow nothing for a\nfather’s anxiety, and think themselves privileged to refuse him their\nconfidence and slight his advice. You must be sensible that as an only\nson, and the representative of an ancient family, your conduct in life\nis most interesting to your connections; and in the very important\nconcern of marriage especially, there is everything at stake—your own\nhappiness, that of your parents, and the credit of your name. I do not\nsuppose that you would deliberately form an absolute engagement of that\nnature without acquainting your mother and myself, or at least, without\nbeing convinced that we should approve of your choice; but I cannot\nhelp fearing that you may be drawn in, by the lady who has lately\nattached you, to a marriage which the whole of your family, far and\nnear, must highly reprobate. Lady Susan’s age is itself a material\nobjection, but her want of character is one so much more serious, that\nthe difference of even twelve years becomes in comparison of small\namount. Were you not blinded by a sort of fascination, it would be\nridiculous in me to repeat the instances of great misconduct on her\nside so very generally known.\n\nHer neglect of her husband, her encouragement of other men, her\nextravagance and dissipation, were so gross and notorious that no one\ncould be ignorant of them at the time, nor can now have forgotten them.\nTo our family she has always been represented in softened colours by\nthe benevolence of Mr. Charles Vernon, and yet, in spite of his\ngenerous endeavours to excuse her, we know that she did, from the most\nselfish motives, take all possible pains to prevent his marriage with\nCatherine.\n\nMy years and increasing infirmities make me very desirous of seeing you\nsettled in the world. To the fortune of a wife, the goodness of my own\nwill make me indifferent, but her family and character must be equally\nunexceptionable. When your choice is fixed so that no objection can be\nmade to it, then I can promise you a ready and cheerful consent; but it\nis my duty to oppose a match which deep art only could render possible,\nand must in the end make wretched. It is possible her behaviour may\narise only from vanity, or the wish of gaining the admiration of a man\nwhom she must imagine to be particularly prejudiced against her; but it\nis more likely that she should aim at something further. She is poor,\nand may naturally seek an alliance which must be advantageous to\nherself; you know your own rights, and that it is out of my power to\nprevent your inheriting the family estate. My ability of distressing\nyou during my life would be a species of revenge to which I could\nhardly stoop under any circumstances.\n\nI honestly tell you my sentiments and intentions: I do not wish to work\non your fears, but on your sense and affection. It would destroy every\ncomfort of my life to know that you were married to Lady Susan Vernon;\nit would be the death of that honest pride with which I have hitherto\nconsidered my son; I should blush to see him, to hear of him, to think\nof him. I may perhaps do no good but that of relieving my own mind by\nthis letter, but I felt it my duty to tell you that your partiality for\nLady Susan is no secret to your friends, and to warn you against her. I\nshould be glad to hear your reasons for disbelieving Mr. Smith’s\nintelligence; you had no doubt of its authenticity a month ago. If you\ncan give me your assurance of having no design beyond enjoying the\nconversation of a clever woman for a short period, and of yielding\nadmiration only to her beauty and abilities, without being blinded by\nthem to her faults, you will restore me to happiness; but, if you\ncannot do this, explain to me, at least, what has occasioned so great\nan alteration in your opinion of her.\n\nI am, &c., &c,\nREGINALD DE COURCY"

I had intended to\nwrite to Reginald myself as soon as my eyes would let me, to point out,\nas well as I could, the danger of an intimate acquaintance, with so\nartful a woman as Lady Susan, to a young man of his age, and high\nexpectations. I meant, moreover, to have reminded him of our being\nquite alone now, and very much in need of him to keep up our spirits\nthese long winter evenings. Whether it would have done any good can\nnever be settled now, but I am excessively vexed that Sir Reginald\nshould know anything of a matter which we foresaw would make him so\nuneasy. He caught all your fears the moment he had read your letter,\nand I am sure he has not had the business out of his head since. He\nwrote by the same post to Reginald a long letter full of it all, and\nparticularly asking an explanation of what he may have heard from Lady\nSusan to contradict the late shocking reports. His answer came this\nmorning, which I shall enclose to you, as I think you will like to see\nit. I wish it was more satisfactory; but it seems written with such a\ndetermination to think well of Lady Susan, that his assurances as to\nmarriage, &c., do not set my heart at ease. I say all I can, however,\nto satisfy your father, and he is certainly less uneasy since\nReginald’s letter. How provoking it is, my dear Catherine, that this\nunwelcome guest of yours should not only prevent our meeting this\nChristmas, but be the occasion of so much vexation and trouble! Kiss\nthe dear children for me.\n\nYour affectionate mother,\nC. DE COURCY."

      "text": "_Mr. De Courcy to Sir Reginald._\n\n\nChurchhill.\n\n\nMy dear Sir,—I have this moment received your letter, which has given\nme more astonishment than I ever felt before. I am to thank my sister,\nI suppose, for having represented me in such a light as to injure me in\nyour opinion, and give you all this alarm. I know not why she should\nchoose to make herself and her family uneasy by apprehending an event\nwhich no one but herself, I can affirm, would ever have thought\npossible. To impute such a design to Lady Susan would be taking from\nher every claim to that excellent understanding which her bitterest\nenemies have never denied her; and equally low must sink my pretensions\nto common sense if I am suspected of matrimonial views in my behaviour\nto her. Our difference of age must be an insuperable objection, and I\nentreat you, my dear father, to quiet your mind, and no longer harbour\na suspicion which cannot be more injurious to your own peace than to\nour understandings. I can have no other view in remaining with Lady\nSusan, than to enjoy for a short time (as you have yourself expressed\nit) the conversation of a woman of high intellectual powers. If Mrs.\nVernon would allow something to my affection for herself and her\nhusband in the length of my visit, she would do more justice to us all;\nbut my sister is unhappily prejudiced beyond the hope of conviction\nagainst Lady Susan. From an attachment to her husband, which in itself\ndoes honour to both, she cannot forgive the endeavours at preventing\ntheir union, which have been attributed to selfishness in Lady Susan;\nbut in this case, as well as in many others, the world has most grossly\ninjured that lady, by supposing the worst where the motives of her\nconduct have been doubtful. Lady Susan had heard something so\nmaterially to the disadvantage of my sister as to persuade her that the\nhappiness of Mr. Vernon, to whom she was always much attached, would be\nwholly destroyed by the marriage. And this circumstance, while it\nexplains the true motives of Lady Susan’s conduct, and removes all the\nblame which has been so lavished on her, may also convince us how\nlittle the general report of anyone ought to be credited; since no\ncharacter, however upright, can escape the malevolence of slander. If\nmy sister, in the security of retirement, with as little opportunity as\ninclination to do evil, could not avoid censure, we must not rashly\ncondemn those who, living in the world and surrounded with temptations,\nshould be accused of errors which they are known to have the power of\ncommitting.\n\nI blame myself severely for having so easily believed the slanderous\ntales invented by Charles Smith to the prejudice of Lady Susan, as I am\nnow convinced how greatly they have traduced her. As to Mrs.\nMainwaring’s jealousy it was totally his own invention, and his account\nof her attaching Miss Mainwaring’s lover was scarcely better founded.\nSir James Martin had been drawn in by that young lady to pay her some\nattention; and as he is a man of fortune, it was easy to see _her_\nviews extended to marriage. It is well known that Miss M. is absolutely\non the catch for a husband, and no one therefore can pity her for\nlosing, by the superior attractions of another woman, the chance of\nbeing able to make a worthy man completely wretched. Lady Susan was far\nfrom intending such a conquest, and on finding how warmly Miss\nMainwaring resented her lover’s defection, determined, in spite of Mr.\nand Mrs. Mainwaring’s most urgent entreaties, to leave the family. I\nhave reason to imagine she did receive serious proposals from Sir\nJames, but her removing from Langford immediately on the discovery of\nhis attachment, must acquit her on that article with any mind of common\ncandour. You will, I am sure, my dear Sir, feel the truth of this, and\nwill hereby learn to do justice to the character of a very injured\nwoman. I know that Lady Susan in coming to Churchhill was governed only\nby the most honourable and amiable intentions; her prudence and economy\nare exemplary, her regard for Mr. Vernon equal even to _his_ deserts;\nand her wish of obtaining my sister’s good opinion merits a better\nreturn than it has received. As a mother she is unexceptionable; her\nsolid affection for her child is shown by placing her in hands where\nher education will be properly attended to; but because she has not the\nblind and weak partiality of most mothers, she is accused of wanting\nmaternal tenderness. Every person of sense, however, will know how to\nvalue and commend her well-directed affection, and will join me in\nwishing that Frederica Vernon may prove more worthy than she has yet\ndone of her mother’s tender care. I have now, my dear father, written\nmy real sentiments of Lady Susan; you will know from this letter how\nhighly I admire her abilities, and esteem her character; but if you are\nnot equally convinced by my full and solemn assurance that your fears\nhave been most idly created, you will deeply mortify and distress me.\n\nI am, &c., &c.,\nR. DE COURCY."

      "text": "_Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy._\n\n\nChurchhill\n\n\nMy dear Mother,—I return you Reginald’s letter, and rejoice with all my\nheart that my father is made easy by it: tell him so, with my\ncongratulations; but, between ourselves, I must own it has only\nconvinced _me_ of my brother’s having no _present_ intention of\nmarrying Lady Susan, not that he is in no danger of doing so three\nmonths hence. He gives a very plausible account of her behaviour at\nLangford; I wish it may be true, but his intelligence must come from\nherself, and I am less disposed to believe it than to lament the degree\nof intimacy subsisting between them, implied by the discussion of such\na subject. I am sorry to have incurred his displeasure, but can expect\nnothing better while he is so very eager in Lady Susan’s justification.\nHe is very severe against me indeed, and yet I hope I have not been\nhasty in my judgment of her. Poor woman! though I have reasons enough\nfor my dislike, I cannot help pitying her at present, as she is in real\ndistress, and with too much cause. She had this morning a letter from\nthe lady with whom she has placed her daughter, to request that Miss\nVernon might be immediately removed, as she had been detected in an\nattempt to run away. Why, or whither she intended to go, does not\nappear; but, as her situation seems to have been unexceptionable, it is\na sad thing, and of course highly distressing to Lady Susan. Frederica\nmust be as much as sixteen, and ought to know better; but from what her\nmother insinuates, I am afraid she is a perverse girl. She has been\nsadly neglected, however, and her mother ought to remember it. Mr.\nVernon set off for London as soon as she had determined what should be\ndone. He is, if possible, to prevail on Miss Summers to let Frederica\ncontinue with her; and if he cannot succeed, to bring her to Churchhill\nfor the present, till some other situation can be found for her. Her\nladyship is comforting herself meanwhile by strolling along the\nshrubbery with Reginald, calling forth all his tender feelings, I\nsuppose, on this distressing occasion. She has been talking a great\ndeal about it to me. She talks vastly well; I am afraid of being\nungenerous, or I should say, _too_ well to feel so very deeply; but I\nwill not look for her faults; she may be Reginald’s wife! Heaven forbid\nit! but why should I be quicker-sighted than anyone else? Mr. Vernon\ndeclares that he never saw deeper distress than hers, on the receipt of\nthe letter; and is his judgment inferior to mine? She was very\nunwilling that Frederica should be allowed to come to Churchhill, and\njustly enough, as it seems a sort of reward to behaviour deserving very\ndifferently; but it was impossible to take her anywhere else, and she\nis not to remain here long. “It will be absolutely necessary,” said\nshe, “as you, my dear sister, must be sensible, to treat my daughter\nwith some severity while she is here; a most painful necessity, but I\nwill _endeavour_ to submit to it. I am afraid I have often been too\nindulgent, but my poor Frederica’s temper could never bear opposition\nwell: you must support and encourage me; you must urge the necessity of\nreproof if you see me too lenient.” All this sounds very reasonable.\nReginald is so incensed against the poor silly girl! Surely it is not\nto Lady Susan’s credit that he should be so bitter against her\ndaughter; his idea of her must be drawn from the mother’s description.\nWell, whatever may be his fate, we have the comfort of knowing that we\nhave done our utmost to save him. We must commit the event to a higher\npower.\n\nYours ever, &c.,\nCATHERINE VERNON."

      "text": "_Lady Susan to Mrs. Johnson._\n\n\nChurchhill.\n\n\nNever, my dearest Alicia, was I so provoked in my life as by a letter\nthis morning from Miss Summers. That horrid girl of mine has been\ntrying to run away. I had not a notion of her being such a little devil\nbefore, she seemed to have all the Vernon milkiness; but on receiving\nthe letter in which I declared my intention about Sir James, she\nactually attempted to elope; at least, I cannot otherwise account for\nher doing it. She meant, I suppose, to go to the Clarkes in\nStaffordshire, for she has no other acquaintances. But she shall be\npunished, she shall have him. I have sent Charles to town to make\nmatters up if he can, for I do not by any means want her here. If Miss\nSummers will not keep her, you must find me out another school, unless\nwe can get her married immediately. Miss S. writes word that she could\nnot get the young lady to assign any cause for her extraordinary\nconduct, which confirms me in my own previous explanation of it.\nFrederica is too shy, I think, and too much in awe of me to tell tales,\nbut if the mildness of her uncle should get anything out of her, I am\nnot afraid. I trust I shall be able to make my story as good as hers.\nIf I am vain of anything, it is of my eloquence. Consideration and\nesteem as surely follow command of language as admiration waits on\nbeauty, and here I have opportunity enough for the exercise of my\ntalent, as the chief of my time is spent in conversation.\n\nReginald is never easy unless we are by ourselves, and when the weather\nis tolerable, we pace the shrubbery for hours together. I like him on\nthe whole very well; he is clever and has a good deal to say, but he is\nsometimes impertinent and troublesome. There is a sort of ridiculous\ndelicacy about him which requires the fullest explanation of whatever\nhe may have heard to my disadvantage, and is never satisfied till he\nthinks he has ascertained the beginning and end of everything. This is\none sort of love, but I confess it does not particularly recommend\nitself to me. I infinitely prefer the tender and liberal spirit of\nMainwaring, which, impressed with the deepest conviction of my merit,\nis satisfied that whatever I do must be right; and look with a degree\nof contempt on the inquisitive and doubtful fancies of that heart which\nseems always debating on the reasonableness of its emotions. Mainwaring\nis indeed, beyond all compare, superior to Reginald—superior in\neverything but the power of being with me! Poor fellow! he is much\ndistracted by jealousy, which I am not sorry for, as I know no better\nsupport of love. He has been teazing me to allow of his coming into\nthis country, and lodging somewhere near _incog_.; but I forbade\neverything of the kind. Those women are inexcusable who forget what is\ndue to themselves, and the opinion of the world.\n\nYours ever,\nS. VERNON."

      "text": "_Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy._\n\n\nChurchhill.\n\n\nMy dear Mother,—Mr. Vernon returned on Thursday night, bringing his\nniece with him. Lady Susan had received a line from him by that day’s\npost, informing her that Miss Summers had absolutely refused to allow\nof Miss Vernon’s continuance in her academy; we were therefore prepared\nfor her arrival, and expected them impatiently the whole evening. They\ncame while we were at tea, and I never saw any creature look so\nfrightened as Frederica when she entered the room. Lady Susan, who had\nbeen shedding tears before, and showing great agitation at the idea of\nthe meeting, received her with perfect self-command, and without\nbetraying the least tenderness of spirit. She hardly spoke to her, and\non Frederica’s bursting into tears as soon as we were seated, took her\nout of the room, and did not return for some time. When she did, her\neyes looked very red and she was as much agitated as before. We saw no\nmore of her daughter. Poor Reginald was beyond measure concerned to see\nhis fair friend in such distress, and watched her with so much tender\nsolicitude, that I, who occasionally caught her observing his\ncountenance with exultation, was quite out of patience. This pathetic\nrepresentation lasted the whole evening, and so ostentatious and artful\na display has entirely convinced me that she did in fact feel nothing.\nI am more angry with her than ever since I have seen her daughter; the\npoor girl looks so unhappy that my heart aches for her. Lady Susan is\nsurely too severe, for Frederica does not seem to have the sort of\ntemper to make severity necessary. She looks perfectly timid, dejected,\nand penitent. She is very pretty, though not so handsome as her mother,\nnor at all like her. Her complexion is delicate, but neither so fair\nnor so blooming as Lady Susan’s, and she has quite the Vernon cast of\ncountenance, the oval face and mild dark eyes, and there is peculiar\nsweetness in her look when she speaks either to her uncle or me, for as\nwe behave kindly to her we have of course engaged her gratitude.\n\nHer mother has insinuated that her temper is intractable, but I never\nsaw a face less indicative of any evil disposition than hers; and from\nwhat I can see of the behaviour of each to the other, the invariable\nseverity of Lady Susan and the silent dejection of Frederica, I am led\nto believe as heretofore that the former has no real love for her\ndaughter, and has never done her justice or treated her affectionately.\nI have not been able to have any conversation with my niece; she is\nshy, and I think I can see that some pains are taken to prevent her\nbeing much with me. Nothing satisfactory transpires as to her reason\nfor running away. Her kind-hearted uncle, you may be sure, was too\nfearful of distressing her to ask many questions as they travelled. I\nwish it had been possible for me to fetch her instead of him. I think I\nshould have discovered the truth in the course of a thirty-mile\njourney. The small pianoforte has been removed within these few days,\nat Lady Susan’s request, into her dressing-room, and Frederica spends\ngreat part of the day there, practising as it is called; but I seldom\nhear any noise when I pass that way; what she does with herself there I\ndo not know. There are plenty of books, but it is not every girl who\nhas been running wild the first fifteen years of her life, that can or\nwill read. Poor creature! the prospect from her window is not very\ninstructive, for that room overlooks the lawn, you know, with the\nshrubbery on one side, where she may see her mother walking for an hour\ntogether in earnest conversation with Reginald. A girl of Frederica’s\nage must be childish indeed, if such things do not strike her. Is it\nnot inexcusable to give such an example to a daughter? Yet Reginald\nstill thinks Lady Susan the best of mothers, and still condemns\nFrederica as a worthless girl! He is convinced that her attempt to run\naway proceeded from no justifiable cause, and had no provocation. I am\nsure I cannot say that it _had_, but while Miss Summers declares that\nMiss Vernon showed no signs of obstinacy or perverseness during her\nwhole stay in Wigmore Street, till she was detected in this scheme, I\ncannot so readily credit what Lady Susan has made him, and wants to\nmake me believe, that it was merely an impatience of restraint and a\ndesire of escaping from the tuition of masters which brought on the\nplan of an elopement. O Reginald, how is your judgment enslaved! He\nscarcely dares even allow her to be handsome, and when I speak of her\nbeauty, replies only that her eyes have no brilliancy! Sometimes he is\nsure she is deficient in understanding, and at others that her temper\nonly is in fault. In short, when a person is always to deceive, it is\nimpossible to be consistent. Lady Susan finds it necessary that\nFrederica should be to blame, and probably has sometimes judged it\nexpedient to accuse her of ill-nature and sometimes to lament her want\nof sense. Reginald is only repeating after her ladyship.\n\nI remain, &c., &c.,\nCATHERINE VERNON."

I so\nvery often see her eyes fixed on his face with a remarkable expression\nof pensive admiration. He is certainly very handsome; and yet more,\nthere is an openness in his manner that must be highly prepossessing,\nand I am sure she feels it so. Thoughtful and pensive in general, her\ncountenance always brightens into a smile when Reginald says anything\namusing; and, let the subject be ever so serious that he may be\nconversing on, I am much mistaken if a syllable of his uttering escapes\nher. I want to make him sensible of all this, for we know the power of\ngratitude on such a heart as his; and could Frederica’s artless\naffection detach him from her mother, we might bless the day which\nbrought her to Churchhill. I think, my dear mother, you would not\ndisapprove of her as a daughter. She is extremely young, to be sure,\nhas had a wretched education, and a dreadful example of levity in her\nmother; but yet I can pronounce her disposition to be excellent, and\nher natural abilities very good. Though totally without\naccomplishments, she is by no means so ignorant as one might expect to\nfind her, being fond of books and spending the chief of her time in\nreading. Her mother leaves her more to herself than she did, and I have\nher with me as much as possible, and have taken great pains to overcome\nher timidity. We are very good friends, and though she never opens her\nlips before her mother, she talks enough when alone with me to make it\nclear that, if properly treated by Lady Susan, she would always appear\nto much greater advantage. There cannot be a more gentle, affectionate\nheart; or more obliging manners, when acting without restraint; and her\nlittle cousins are all very fond of her.\n\nYour affectionate daughter,\nC.

      "text": "_Lady Susan to Mrs. Johnson._\n\n\nChurchhill.\n\n\nYou will be eager, I know, to hear something further of Frederica, and\nperhaps may think me negligent for not writing before. She arrived with\nher uncle last Thursday fortnight, when, of course, I lost no time in\ndemanding the cause of her behaviour; and soon found myself to have\nbeen perfectly right in attributing it to my own letter. The prospect\nof it frightened her so thoroughly, that, with a mixture of true\ngirlish perverseness and folly, she resolved on getting out of the\nhouse and proceeding directly by the stage to her friends, the Clarkes;\nand had really got as far as the length of two streets in her journey\nwhen she was fortunately missed, pursued, and overtaken. Such was the\nfirst distinguished exploit of Miss Frederica Vernon; and, if we\nconsider that it was achieved at the tender age of sixteen, we shall\nhave room for the most flattering prognostics of her future renown. I\nam excessively provoked, however, at the parade of propriety which\nprevented Miss Summers from keeping the girl; and it seems so\nextraordinary a piece of nicety, considering my daughter’s family\nconnections, that I can only suppose the lady to be governed by the\nfear of never getting her money. Be that as it may, however, Frederica\nis returned on my hands; and, having nothing else to employ her, is\nbusy in pursuing the plan of romance begun at Langford. She is actually\nfalling in love with Reginald De Courcy! To disobey her mother by\nrefusing an unexceptionable offer is not enough; her affections must\nalso be given without her mother’s approbation. I never saw a girl of\nher age bid fairer to be the sport of mankind. Her feelings are\ntolerably acute, and she is so charmingly artless in their display as\nto afford the most reasonable hope of her being ridiculous, and\ndespised by every man who sees her.\n\nArtlessness will never do in love matters; and that girl is born a\nsimpleton who has it either by nature or affectation. I am not yet\ncertain that Reginald sees what she is about, nor is it of much\nconsequence. She is now an object of indifference to him, and she would\nbe one of contempt were he to understand her emotions. Her beauty is\nmuch admired by the Vernons, but it has no effect on him. She is in\nhigh favour with her aunt altogether, because she is so little like\nmyself, of course. She is exactly the companion for Mrs. Vernon, who\ndearly loves to be firm, and to have all the sense and all the wit of\nthe conversation to herself: Frederica will never eclipse her. When she\nfirst came I was at some pains to prevent her seeing much of her aunt;\nbut I have relaxed, as I believe I may depend on her observing the\nrules I have laid down for their discourse. But do not imagine that\nwith all this lenity I have for a moment given up my plan of her\nmarriage. No; I am unalterably fixed on this point, though I have not\nyet quite decided on the manner of bringing it about. I should not\nchuse to have the business brought on here, and canvassed by the wise\nheads of Mr. and Mrs. Vernon; and I cannot just now afford to go to\ntown. Miss Frederica must therefore wait a little.\n\nYours ever,\nS. VERNON."

      "text": "_Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy._\n\n\nChurchhill\n\n\nWe have a very unexpected guest with us at present, my dear Mother: he\narrived yesterday. I heard a carriage at the door, as I was sitting\nwith my children while they dined; and supposing I should be wanted,\nleft the nursery soon afterwards, and was half-way downstairs, when\nFrederica, as pale as ashes, came running up, and rushed by me into her\nown room. I instantly followed, and asked her what was the matter.\n“Oh!” said she, “he is come—Sir James is come, and what shall I do?”\nThis was no explanation; I begged her to tell me what she meant. At\nthat moment we were interrupted by a knock at the door: it was\nReginald, who came, by Lady Susan’s direction, to call Frederica down.\n“It is Mr. De Courcy!” said she, colouring violently. “Mamma has sent\nfor me; I must go.” We all three went down together; and I saw my\nbrother examining the terrified face of Frederica with surprize. In the\nbreakfast-room we found Lady Susan, and a young man of gentlemanlike\nappearance, whom she introduced by the name of Sir James Martin—the\nvery person, as you may remember, whom it was said she had been at\npains to detach from Miss Mainwaring; but the conquest, it seems, was\nnot designed for herself, or she has since transferred it to her\ndaughter; for Sir James is now desperately in love with Frederica, and\nwith full encouragement from mamma. The poor girl, however, I am sure,\ndislikes him; and though his person and address are very well, he\nappears, both to Mr. Vernon and me, a very weak young man. Frederica\nlooked so shy, so confused, when we entered the room, that I felt for\nher exceedingly. Lady Susan behaved with great attention to her\nvisitor; and yet I thought I could perceive that she had no particular\npleasure in seeing him. Sir James talked a great deal, and made many\ncivil excuses to me for the liberty he had taken in coming to\nChurchhill—mixing more frequent laughter with his discourse than the\nsubject required—said many things over and over again, and told Lady\nSusan three times that he had seen Mrs. Johnson a few evenings before.\nHe now and then addressed Frederica, but more frequently her mother.\nThe poor girl sat all this time without opening her lips—her eyes cast\ndown, and her colour varying every instant; while Reginald observed all\nthat passed in perfect silence. At length Lady Susan, weary, I believe,\nof her situation, proposed walking; and we left the two gentlemen\ntogether, to put on our pelisses. As we went upstairs Lady Susan begged\npermission to attend me for a few moments in my dressing-room, as she\nwas anxious to speak with me in private. I led her thither accordingly,\nand as soon as the door was closed, she said: “I was never more\nsurprized in my life than by Sir James’s arrival, and the suddenness of\nit requires some apology to you, my dear sister; though to _me_, as a\nmother, it is highly flattering. He is so extremely attached to my\ndaughter that he could not exist longer without seeing her. Sir James\nis a young man of an amiable disposition and excellent character; a\nlittle too much of the rattle, perhaps, but a year or two will rectify\n_that:_ and he is in other respects so very eligible a match for\nFrederica, that I have always observed his attachment with the greatest\npleasure; and am persuaded that you and my brother will give the\nalliance your hearty approbation. I have never before mentioned the\nlikelihood of its taking place to anyone, because I thought that whilst\nFrederica continued at school it had better not be known to exist; but\nnow, as I am convinced that Frederica is too old ever to submit to\nschool confinement, and have, therefore, begun to consider her union\nwith Sir James as not very distant, I had intended within a few days to\nacquaint yourself and Mr. Vernon with the whole business. I am sure, my\ndear sister, you will excuse my remaining silent so long, and agree\nwith me that such circumstances, while they continue from any cause in\nsuspense, cannot be too cautiously concealed. When you have the\nhappiness of bestowing your sweet little Catherine, some years hence,\non a man who in connection and character is alike unexceptionable, you\nwill know what I feel now; though, thank Heaven, you cannot have all my\nreasons for rejoicing in such an event. Catherine will be amply\nprovided for, and not, like my Frederica, indebted to a fortunate\nestablishment for the comforts of life.” She concluded by demanding my\ncongratulations. I gave them somewhat awkwardly, I believe; for, in\nfact, the sudden disclosure of so important a matter took from me the\npower of speaking with any clearness. She thanked me, however, most\naffectionately, for my kind concern in the welfare of herself and\ndaughter; and then said: “I am not apt to deal in professions, my dear\nMrs. Vernon, and I never had the convenient talent of affecting\nsensations foreign to my heart; and therefore I trust you will believe\nme when I declare, that much as I had heard in your praise before I\nknew you, I had no idea that I should ever love you as I now do; and I\nmust further say that your friendship towards me is more particularly\ngratifying because I have reason to believe that some attempts were\nmade to prejudice you against me. I only wish that they, whoever they\nare, to whom I am indebted for such kind intentions, could see the\nterms on which we now are together, and understand the real affection\nwe feel for each other; but I will not detain you any longer. God bless\nyou, for your goodness to me and my girl, and continue to you all your\npresent happiness.” What can one say of such a woman, my dear mother?\nSuch earnestness, such solemnity of expression! and yet I cannot help\nsuspecting the truth of everything she says. As for Reginald, I believe\nhe does not know what to make of the matter. When Sir James came, he\nappeared all astonishment and perplexity; the folly of the young man\nand the confusion of Frederica entirely engrossed him; and though a\nlittle private discourse with Lady Susan has since had its effect, he\nis still hurt, I am sure, at her allowing of such a man’s attentions to\nher daughter. Sir James invited himself with great composure to remain\nhere a few days—hoped we would not think it odd, was aware of its being\nvery impertinent, but he took the liberty of a relation; and concluded\nby wishing, with a laugh, that he might be really one very soon. Even\nLady Susan seemed a little disconcerted by this forwardness; in her\nheart I am persuaded she sincerely wished him gone. But something must\nbe done for this poor girl, if her feelings are such as both I and her\nuncle believe them to be. She must not be sacrificed to policy or\nambition, and she must not be left to suffer from the dread of it. The\ngirl whose heart can distinguish Reginald De Courcy, deserves, however\nhe may slight her, a better fate than to be Sir James Martin’s wife. As\nsoon as I can get her alone, I will discover the real truth; but she\nseems to wish to avoid me. I hope this does not proceed from anything\nwrong, and that I shall not find out I have thought too well of her.\nHer behaviour to Sir James certainly speaks the greatest consciousness\nand embarrassment, but I see nothing in it more like encouragement.\nAdieu, my dear mother.\n\nYours, &c.,\nC. VERNON."

      "text": "_Lady Susan to Mrs. Johnson._\n\n\nChurchhill.\n\n\nThis is insufferable! My dearest friend, I was never so enraged before,\nand must relieve myself by writing to you, who I know will enter into\nall my feelings. Who should come on Tuesday but Sir James Martin! Guess\nmy astonishment, and vexation—for, as you well know, I never wished him\nto be seen at Churchhill. What a pity that you should not have known\nhis intentions! Not content with coming, he actually invited himself to\nremain here a few days. I could have poisoned him! I made the best of\nit, however, and told my story with great success to Mrs. Vernon, who,\nwhatever might be her real sentiments, said nothing in opposition to\nmine. I made a point also of Frederica’s behaving civilly to Sir James,\nand gave her to understand that I was absolutely determined on her\nmarrying him. She said something of her misery, but that was all. I\nhave for some time been more particularly resolved on the match from\nseeing the rapid increase of her affection for Reginald, and from not\nfeeling secure that a knowledge of such affection might not in the end\nawaken a return. Contemptible as a regard founded only on compassion\nmust make them both in my eyes, I felt by no means assured that such\nmight not be the consequence. It is true that Reginald had not in any\ndegree grown cool towards me; but yet he has lately mentioned Frederica\nspontaneously and unnecessarily, and once said something in praise of\nher person. _He_ was all astonishment at the appearance of my visitor,\nand at first observed Sir James with an attention which I was pleased\nto see not unmixed with jealousy; but unluckily it was impossible for\nme really to torment him, as Sir James, though extremely gallant to me,\nvery soon made the whole party understand that his heart was devoted to\nmy daughter. I had no great difficulty in convincing De Courcy, when we\nwere alone, that I was perfectly justified, all things considered, in\ndesiring the match; and the whole business seemed most comfortably\narranged. They could none of them help perceiving that Sir James was no\nSolomon; but I had positively forbidden Frederica complaining to\nCharles Vernon or his wife, and they had therefore no pretence for\ninterference; though my impertinent sister, I believe, wanted only\nopportunity for doing so. Everything, however, was going on calmly and\nquietly; and, though I counted the hours of Sir James’s stay, my mind\nwas entirely satisfied with the posture of affairs. Guess, then, what I\nmust feel at the sudden disturbance of all my schemes; and that, too,\nfrom a quarter where I had least reason to expect it. Reginald came\nthis morning into my dressing-room with a very unusual solemnity of\ncountenance, and after some preface informed me in so many words that\nhe wished to reason with me on the impropriety and unkindness of\nallowing Sir James Martin to address my daughter contrary to her\ninclinations. I was all amazement. When I found that he was not to be\nlaughed out of his design, I calmly begged an explanation, and desired\nto know by what he was impelled, and by whom commissioned, to reprimand\nme. He then told me, mixing in his speech a few insolent compliments\nand ill-timed expressions of tenderness, to which I listened with\nperfect indifference, that my daughter had acquainted him with some\ncircumstances concerning herself, Sir James, and me which had given him\ngreat uneasiness. In short, I found that she had in the first place\nactually written to him to request his interference, and that, on\nreceiving her letter, he had conversed with her on the subject of it,\nin order to understand the particulars, and to assure himself of her\nreal wishes. I have not a doubt but that the girl took this opportunity\nof making downright love to him. I am convinced of it by the manner in\nwhich he spoke of her. Much good may such love do him! I shall ever\ndespise the man who can be gratified by the passion which he never\nwished to inspire, nor solicited the avowal of. I shall always detest\nthem both. He can have no true regard for me, or he would not have\nlistened to her; and _she_, with her little rebellious heart and\nindelicate feelings, to throw herself into the protection of a young\nman with whom she has scarcely ever exchanged two words before! I am\nequally confounded at _her_ impudence and _his_ credulity. How dared he\nbelieve what she told him in my disfavour! Ought he not to have felt\nassured that I must have unanswerable motives for all that I had done?\nWhere was his reliance on my sense and goodness then? Where the\nresentment which true love would have dictated against the person\ndefaming me—that person, too, a chit, a child, without talent or\neducation, whom he had been always taught to despise? I was calm for\nsome time; but the greatest degree of forbearance may be overcome, and\nI hope I was afterwards sufficiently keen. He endeavoured, long\nendeavoured, to soften my resentment; but that woman is a fool indeed\nwho, while insulted by accusation, can be worked on by compliments. At\nlength he left me, as deeply provoked as myself; and he showed his\nanger more. I was quite cool, but he gave way to the most violent\nindignation; I may therefore expect it will the sooner subside, and\nperhaps his may be vanished for ever, while mine will be found still\nfresh and implacable. He is now shut up in his apartment, whither I\nheard him go on leaving mine. How unpleasant, one would think, must be\nhis reflections! but some people’s feelings are incomprehensible. I\nhave not yet tranquillised myself enough to see Frederica. _She_ shall\nnot soon forget the occurrences of this day; she shall find that she\nhas poured forth her tender tale of love in vain, and exposed herself\nfor ever to the contempt of the whole world, and the severest\nresentment of her injured mother.\n\nYour affectionate\nS. VERNON."

      "text": "_Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy._\n\n\nChurchhill.\n\n\nLet me congratulate you, my dearest Mother! The affair which has given\nus so much anxiety is drawing to a happy conclusion. Our prospect is\nmost delightful, and since matters have now taken so favourable a turn,\nI am quite sorry that I ever imparted my apprehensions to you; for the\npleasure of learning that the danger is over is perhaps dearly\npurchased by all that you have previously suffered. I am so much\nagitated by delight that I can scarcely hold a pen; but am determined\nto send you a few short lines by James, that you may have some\nexplanation of what must so greatly astonish you, as that Reginald\nshould be returning to Parklands. I was sitting about half an hour ago\nwith Sir James in the breakfast parlour, when my brother called me out\nof the room. I instantly saw that something was the matter; his\ncomplexion was raised, and he spoke with great emotion; you know his\neager manner, my dear mother, when his mind is interested. “Catherine,”\nsaid he, “I am going home to-day; I am sorry to leave you, but I must\ngo: it is a great while since I have seen my father and mother. I am\ngoing to send James forward with my hunters immediately; if you have\nany letter, therefore, he can take it. I shall not be at home myself\ntill Wednesday or Thursday, as I shall go through London, where I have\nbusiness; but before I leave you,” he continued, speaking in a lower\ntone, and with still greater energy, “I must warn you of one thing—do\nnot let Frederica Vernon be made unhappy by that Martin. He wants to\nmarry her; her mother promotes the match, but she cannot endure the\nidea of it. Be assured that I speak from the fullest conviction of the\ntruth of what I say; I know that Frederica is made wretched by Sir\nJames’s continuing here. She is a sweet girl, and deserves a better\nfate. Send him away immediately; he is only a fool: but what her mother\ncan mean, Heaven only knows! Good bye,” he added, shaking my hand with\nearnestness; “I do not know when you will see me again; but remember\nwhat I tell you of Frederica; you _must_ make it your business to see\njustice done her. She is an amiable girl, and has a very superior mind\nto what we have given her credit for.” He then left me, and ran\nupstairs. I would not try to stop him, for I knew what his feelings\nmust be. The nature of mine, as I listened to him, I need not attempt\nto describe; for a minute or two I remained in the same spot,\noverpowered by wonder of a most agreeable sort indeed; yet it required\nsome consideration to be tranquilly happy. In about ten minutes after\nmy return to the parlour Lady Susan entered the room. I concluded, of\ncourse, that she and Reginald had been quarrelling; and looked with\nanxious curiosity for a confirmation of my belief in her face. Mistress\nof deceit, however, she appeared perfectly unconcerned, and after\nchatting on indifferent subjects for a short time, said to me, “I find\nfrom Wilson that we are going to lose Mr. De Courcy—is it true that he\nleaves Churchhill this morning?” I replied that it was. “He told us\nnothing of all this last night,” said she, laughing, “or even this\nmorning at breakfast; but perhaps he did not know it himself. Young men\nare often hasty in their resolutions, and not more sudden in forming\nthan unsteady in keeping them. I should not be surprised if he were to\nchange his mind at last, and not go.” She soon afterwards left the\nroom. I trust, however, my dear mother, that we have no reason to fear\nan alteration of his present plan; things have gone too far. They must\nhave quarrelled, and about Frederica, too. Her calmness astonishes me.\nWhat delight will be yours in seeing him again; in seeing him still\nworthy your esteem, still capable of forming your happiness! When I\nnext write I shall be able to tell you that Sir James is gone, Lady\nSusan vanquished, and Frederica at peace. We have much to do, but it\nshall be done. I am all impatience to hear how this astonishing change\nwas effected. I finish as I began, with the warmest congratulations.\n\nYours ever, &c.,\nCATH. VERNON."

      "text": "_From the same to the same._\n\n\nChurchhill.\n\n\nLittle did I imagine, my dear Mother, when I sent off my last letter,\nthat the delightful perturbation of spirits I was then in would undergo\nso speedy, so melancholy a reverse. I never can sufficiently regret\nthat I wrote to you at all. Yet who could have foreseen what has\nhappened? My dear mother, every hope which made me so happy only two\nhours ago has vanished. The quarrel between Lady Susan and Reginald is\nmade up, and we are all as we were before. One point only is gained.\nSir James Martin is dismissed. What are we now to look forward to? I am\nindeed disappointed; Reginald was all but gone, his horse was ordered\nand all but brought to the door; who would not have felt safe? For half\nan hour I was in momentary expectation of his departure. After I had\nsent off my letter to you, I went to Mr. Vernon, and sat with him in\nhis room talking over the whole matter, and then determined to look for\nFrederica, whom I had not seen since breakfast. I met her on the\nstairs, and saw that she was crying. “My dear aunt,” said she, “he is\ngoing—Mr. De Courcy is going, and it is all my fault. I am afraid you\nwill be very angry with me, but indeed I had no idea it would end so.”\n“My love,” I replied, “do not think it necessary to apologize to me on\nthat account. I shall feel myself under an obligation to anyone who is\nthe means of sending my brother home, because,” recollecting myself, “I\nknow my father wants very much to see him. But what is it you have done\nto occasion all this?” She blushed deeply as she answered: “I was so\nunhappy about Sir James that I could not help—I have done something\nvery wrong, I know; but you have not an idea of the misery I have been\nin: and mamma had ordered me never to speak to you or my uncle about\nit, and—” “You therefore spoke to my brother to engage his\ninterference,” said I, to save her the explanation. “No, but I wrote to\nhim—I did indeed, I got up this morning before it was light, and was\ntwo hours about it; and when my letter was done I thought I never\nshould have courage to give it. After breakfast however, as I was going\nto my room, I met him in the passage, and then, as I knew that\neverything must depend on that moment, I forced myself to give it. He\nwas so good as to take it immediately. I dared not look at him, and ran\naway directly. I was in such a fright I could hardly breathe. My dear\naunt, you do not know how miserable I have been.” “Frederica” said I,\n“you ought to have told me all your distresses. You would have found in\nme a friend always ready to assist you. Do you think that your uncle or\nI should not have espoused your cause as warmly as my brother?”\n“Indeed, I did not doubt your kindness,” said she, colouring again,\n“but I thought Mr. De Courcy could do anything with my mother; but I\nwas mistaken: they have had a dreadful quarrel about it, and he is\ngoing away. Mamma will never forgive me, and I shall be worse off than\never.” “No, you shall not,” I replied; “in such a point as this your\nmother’s prohibition ought not to have prevented your speaking to me on\nthe subject. She has no right to make you unhappy, and she shall _not_\ndo it. Your applying, however, to Reginald can be productive only of\ngood to all parties. I believe it is best as it is. Depend upon it that\nyou shall not be made unhappy any longer.” At that moment how great was\nmy astonishment at seeing Reginald come out of Lady Susan’s\ndressing-room. My heart misgave me instantly. His confusion at seeing\nme was very evident. Frederica immediately disappeared. “Are you\ngoing?” I said; “you will find Mr. Vernon in his own room.” “No,\nCatherine,” he replied, “I am not going. Will you let me speak to you a\nmoment?” We went into my room. “I find,” he continued, his confusion\nincreasing as he spoke, “that I have been acting with my usual foolish\nimpetuosity. I have entirely misunderstood Lady Susan, and was on the\npoint of leaving the house under a false impression of her conduct.\nThere has been some very great mistake; we have been all mistaken, I\nfancy. Frederica does not know her mother. Lady Susan means nothing but\nher good, but she will not make a friend of her. Lady Susan does not\nalways know, therefore, what will make her daughter happy. Besides, I\ncould have no right to interfere. Miss Vernon was mistaken in applying\nto me. In short, Catherine, everything has gone wrong, but it is now\nall happily settled. Lady Susan, I believe, wishes to speak to you\nabout it, if you are at leisure.” “Certainly,” I replied, deeply\nsighing at the recital of so lame a story. I made no comments, however,\nfor words would have been vain.\n\nReginald was glad to get away, and I went to Lady Susan, curious,\nindeed, to hear her account of it. “Did I not tell you,” said she with\na smile, “that your brother would not leave us after all?” “You did,\nindeed,” replied I very gravely; “but I flattered myself you would be\nmistaken.” “I should not have hazarded such an opinion,” returned she,\n“if it had not at that moment occurred to me that his resolution of\ngoing might be occasioned by a conversation in which we had been this\nmorning engaged, and which had ended very much to his dissatisfaction,\nfrom our not rightly understanding each other’s meaning. This idea\nstruck me at the moment, and I instantly determined that an accidental\ndispute, in which I might probably be as much to blame as himself,\nshould not deprive you of your brother. If you remember, I left the\nroom almost immediately. I was resolved to lose no time in clearing up\nthose mistakes as far as I could. The case was this—Frederica had set\nherself violently against marrying Sir James.” “And can your ladyship\nwonder that she should?” cried I with some warmth; “Frederica has an\nexcellent understanding, and Sir James has none.” “I am at least very\nfar from regretting it, my dear sister,” said she; “on the contrary, I\nam grateful for so favourable a sign of my daughter’s sense. Sir James\nis certainly below par (his boyish manners make him appear worse); and\nhad Frederica possessed the penetration and the abilities which I could\nhave wished in my daughter, or had I even known her to possess as much\nas she does, I should not have been anxious for the match.” “It is odd\nthat you should alone be ignorant of your daughter’s sense!” “Frederica\nnever does justice to herself; her manners are shy and childish, and\nbesides she is afraid of me. During her poor father’s life she was a\nspoilt child; the severity which it has since been necessary for me to\nshow has alienated her affection; neither has she any of that\nbrilliancy of intellect, that genius or vigour of mind which will force\nitself forward.” “Say rather that she has been unfortunate in her\neducation!” “Heaven knows, my dearest Mrs. Vernon, how fully I am aware\nof that; but I would wish to forget every circumstance that might throw\nblame on the memory of one whose name is sacred with me.” Here she\npretended to cry; I was out of patience with her. “But what,” said I,\n“was your ladyship going to tell me about your disagreement with my\nbrother?” “It originated in an action of my daughter’s, which equally\nmarks her want of judgment and the unfortunate dread of me I have been\nmentioning—she wrote to Mr. De Courcy.” “I know she did; you had\nforbidden her speaking to Mr. Vernon or to me on the cause of her\ndistress; what could she do, therefore, but apply to my brother?” “Good\nGod!” she exclaimed, “what an opinion you must have of me! Can you\npossibly suppose that I was aware of her unhappiness! that it was my\nobject to make my own child miserable, and that I had forbidden her\nspeaking to you on the subject from a fear of your interrupting the\ndiabolical scheme? Do you think me destitute of every honest, every\nnatural feeling? Am I capable of consigning _her_ to everlasting misery\nwhose welfare it is my first earthly duty to promote? The idea is\nhorrible!” “What, then, was your intention when you insisted on her\nsilence?” “Of what use, my dear sister, could be any application to\nyou, however the affair might stand? Why should I subject you to\nentreaties which I refused to attend to myself? Neither for your sake\nnor for hers, nor for my own, could such a thing be desirable. When my\nown resolution was taken I could not wish for the interference, however\nfriendly, of another person. I was mistaken, it is true, but I believed\nmyself right.” “But what was this mistake to which your ladyship so\noften alludes? from whence arose so astonishing a misconception of your\ndaughter’s feelings? Did you not know that she disliked Sir James?” “I\nknew that he was not absolutely the man she would have chosen, but I\nwas persuaded that her objections to him did not arise from any\nperception of his deficiency. You must not question me, however, my\ndear sister, too minutely on this point,” continued she, taking me\naffectionately by the hand; “I honestly own that there is something to\nconceal. Frederica makes me very unhappy! Her applying to Mr. De Courcy\nhurt me particularly.” “What is it you mean to infer,” said I, “by this\nappearance of mystery? If you think your daughter at all attached to\nReginald, her objecting to Sir James could not less deserve to be\nattended to than if the cause of her objecting had been a consciousness\nof his folly; and why should your ladyship, at any rate, quarrel with\nmy brother for an interference which, you must know, it is not in his\nnature to refuse when urged in such a manner?”\n\n“His disposition, you know, is warm, and he came to expostulate with\nme; his compassion all alive for this ill-used girl, this heroine in\ndistress! We misunderstood each other: he believed me more to blame\nthan I really was; I considered his interference less excusable than I\nnow find it. I have a real regard for him, and was beyond expression\nmortified to find it, as I thought, so ill bestowed. We were both warm,\nand of course both to blame. His resolution of leaving Churchhill is\nconsistent with his general eagerness. When I understood his intention,\nhowever, and at the same time began to think that we had been perhaps\nequally mistaken in each other’s meaning, I resolved to have an\nexplanation before it was too late. For any member of your family I\nmust always feel a degree of affection, and I own it would have\nsensibly hurt me if my acquaintance with Mr. De Courcy had ended so\ngloomily. I have now only to say further, that as I am convinced of\nFrederica’s having a reasonable dislike to Sir James, I shall instantly\ninform him that he must give up all hope of her. I reproach myself for\nhaving, even though innocently, made her unhappy on that score. She\nshall have all the retribution in my power to make; if she value her\nown happiness as much as I do, if she judge wisely, and command herself\nas she ought, she may now be easy. Excuse me, my dearest sister, for\nthus trespassing on your time, but I owe it to my own character; and\nafter this explanation I trust I am in no danger of sinking in your\nopinion.” I could have said, “Not much, indeed!” but I left her almost\nin silence. It was the greatest stretch of forbearance I could\npractise. I could not have stopped myself had I begun. Her assurance!\nher deceit! but I will not allow myself to dwell on them; they will\nstrike you sufficiently. My heart sickens within me. As soon as I was\ntolerably composed I returned to the parlour. Sir James’s carriage was\nat the door, and he, merry as usual, soon afterwards took his leave.\nHow easily does her ladyship encourage or dismiss a lover! In spite of\nthis release, Frederica still looks unhappy: still fearful, perhaps, of\nher mother’s anger; and though dreading my brother’s departure,\njealous, it may be, of his staying. I see how closely she observes him\nand Lady Susan, poor girl! I have now no hope for her. There is not a\nchance of her affection being returned. He thinks very differently of\nher from what he used to do; he does her some justice, but his\nreconciliation with her mother precludes every dearer hope. Prepare, my\ndear mother, for the worst! The probability of their marrying is surely\nheightened! He is more securely hers than ever. When that wretched\nevent takes place, Frederica must belong wholly to us. I am thankful\nthat my last letter will precede this by so little, as every moment\nthat you can be saved from feeling a joy which leads only to\ndisappointment is of consequence.\n\nYours ever, &c.,\nCATHERINE VERNON."

      "text": "_Lady Susan to Mrs. Johnson._\n\n\nChurchhill.\n\n\nI call on you, dear Alicia, for congratulations: I am my own self, gay\nand triumphant! When I wrote to you the other day I was, in truth, in\nhigh irritation, and with ample cause. Nay, I know not whether I ought\nto be quite tranquil now, for I have had more trouble in restoring\npeace than I ever intended to submit to—a spirit, too, resulting from a\nfancied sense of superior integrity, which is peculiarly insolent! I\nshall not easily forgive him, I assure you. He was actually on the\npoint of leaving Churchhill! I had scarcely concluded my last, when\nWilson brought me word of it. I found, therefore, that something must\nbe done; for I did not choose to leave my character at the mercy of a\nman whose passions are so violent and so revengeful. It would have been\ntrifling with my reputation to allow of his departing with such an\nimpression in my disfavour; in this light, condescension was necessary.\nI sent Wilson to say that I desired to speak with him before he went;\nhe came immediately. The angry emotions which had marked every feature\nwhen we last parted were partially subdued. He seemed astonished at the\nsummons, and looked as if half wishing and half fearing to be softened\nby what I might say. If my countenance expressed what I aimed at, it\nwas composed and dignified; and yet, with a degree of pensiveness which\nmight convince him that I was not quite happy. “I beg your pardon, sir,\nfor the liberty I have taken in sending for you,” said I; “but as I\nhave just learnt your intention of leaving this place to-day, I feel it\nmy duty to entreat that you will not on my account shorten your visit\nhere even an hour. I am perfectly aware that after what has passed\nbetween us it would ill suit the feelings of either to remain longer in\nthe same house: so very great, so total a change from the intimacy of\nfriendship must render any future intercourse the severest punishment;\nand your resolution of quitting Churchhill is undoubtedly in unison\nwith our situation, and with those lively feelings which I know you to\npossess. But, at the same time, it is not for me to suffer such a\nsacrifice as it must be to leave relations to whom you are so much\nattached, and are so dear. My remaining here cannot give that pleasure\nto Mr. and Mrs. Vernon which your society must; and my visit has\nalready perhaps been too long. My removal, therefore, which must, at\nany rate, take place soon, may, with perfect convenience, be hastened;\nand I make it my particular request that I may not in any way be\ninstrumental in separating a family so affectionately attached to each\nother. Where I go is of no consequence to anyone; of very little to\nmyself; but you are of importance to all your connections.” Here I\nconcluded, and I hope you will be satisfied with my speech. Its effect\non Reginald justifies some portion of vanity, for it was no less\nfavourable than instantaneous. Oh, how delightful it was to watch the\nvariations of his countenance while I spoke! to see the struggle\nbetween returning tenderness and the remains of displeasure. There is\nsomething agreeable in feelings so easily worked on; not that I envy\nhim their possession, nor would, for the world, have such myself; but\nthey are very convenient when one wishes to influence the passions of\nanother. And yet this Reginald, whom a very few words from me softened\nat once into the utmost submission, and rendered more tractable, more\nattached, more devoted than ever, would have left me in the first angry\nswelling of his proud heart without deigning to seek an explanation.\nHumbled as he now is, I cannot forgive him such an instance of pride,\nand am doubtful whether I ought not to punish him by dismissing him at\nonce after this reconciliation, or by marrying and teazing him for\never. But these measures are each too violent to be adopted without\nsome deliberation; at present my thoughts are fluctuating between\nvarious schemes. I have many things to compass: I must punish\nFrederica, and pretty severely too, for her application to Reginald; I\nmust punish him for receiving it so favourably, and for the rest of his\nconduct. I must torment my sister-in-law for the insolent triumph of\nher look and manner since Sir James has been dismissed; for, in\nreconciling Reginald to me, I was not able to save that ill-fated young\nman; and I must make myself amends for the humiliation to which I have\nstooped within these few days. To effect all this I have various plans.\nI have also an idea of being soon in town; and whatever may be my\ndetermination as to the rest, I shall probably put _that_ project in\nexecution; for London will be always the fairest field of action,\nhowever my views may be directed; and at any rate I shall there be\nrewarded by your society, and a little dissipation, for a ten weeks’\npenance at Churchhill. I believe I owe it to my character to complete\nthe match between my daughter and Sir James after having so long\nintended it. Let me know your opinion on this point. Flexibility of\nmind, a disposition easily biassed by others, is an attribute which you\nknow I am not very desirous of obtaining; nor has Frederica any claim\nto the indulgence of her notions at the expense of her mother’s\ninclinations. Her idle love for Reginald, too! It is surely my duty to\ndiscourage such romantic nonsense. All things considered, therefore, it\nseems incumbent on me to take her to town and marry her immediately to\nSir James. When my own will is effected contrary to his, I shall have\nsome credit in being on good terms with Reginald, which at present, in\nfact, I have not; for though he is still in my power, I have given up\nthe very article by which our quarrel was produced, and at best the\nhonour of victory is doubtful. Send me your opinion on all these\nmatters, my dear Alicia, and let me know whether you can get lodgings\nto suit me within a short distance of you.\n\nYour most attached\nS. VERNON."

      "text": "_Mrs. Johnson to Lady Susan._\n\n\nEdward Street.\n\n\nI am gratified by your reference, and this is my advice: that you come\nto town yourself, without loss of time, but that you leave Frederica\nbehind. It would surely be much more to the purpose to get yourself\nwell established by marrying Mr. De Courcy, than to irritate him and\nthe rest of his family by making her marry Sir James. You should think\nmore of yourself and less of your daughter. She is not of a disposition\nto do you credit in the world, and seems precisely in her proper place\nat Churchhill, with the Vernons. But you are fitted for society, and it\nis shameful to have you exiled from it. Leave Frederica, therefore, to\npunish herself for the plague she has given you, by indulging that\nromantic tender-heartedness which will always ensure her misery enough,\nand come to London as soon as you can. I have another reason for urging\nthis: Mainwaring came to town last week, and has contrived, in spite of\nMr. Johnson, to make opportunities of seeing me. He is absolutely\nmiserable about you, and jealous to such a degree of De Courcy that it\nwould be highly unadvisable for them to meet at present. And yet, if\nyou do not allow him to see you here, I cannot answer for his not\ncommitting some great imprudence—such as going to Churchhill, for\ninstance, which would be dreadful! Besides, if you take my advice, and\nresolve to marry De Courcy, it will be indispensably necessary to you\nto get Mainwaring out of the way; and you only can have influence\nenough to send him back to his wife. I have still another motive for\nyour coming: Mr. Johnson leaves London next Tuesday; he is going for\nhis health to Bath, where, if the waters are favourable to his\nconstitution and my wishes, he will be laid up with the gout many\nweeks. During his absence we shall be able to chuse our own society,\nand to have true enjoyment. I would ask you to Edward Street, but that\nonce he forced from me a kind of promise never to invite you to my\nhouse; nothing but my being in the utmost distress for money should\nhave extorted it from me. I can get you, however, a nice drawing-room\napartment in Upper Seymour Street, and we may be always together there\nor here; for I consider my promise to Mr. Johnson as comprehending only\n(at least in his absence) your not sleeping in the house. Poor\nMainwaring gives me such histories of his wife’s jealousy. Silly woman\nto expect constancy from so charming a man! but she always was\nsilly—intolerably so in marrying him at all, she the heiress of a large\nfortune and he without a shilling: one title, I know, she might have\nhad, besides baronets. Her folly in forming the connection was so great\nthat, though Mr. Johnson was her guardian, and I do not in general\nshare _his_ feelings, I never can forgive her.\n\nAdieu. Yours ever,\nALICIA."

His long\nvisit is about to be concluded at last, but I fear the separation takes\nplace too late to do us any good. She is going to London to see her\nparticular friend, Mrs. Johnson. It was at first her intention that\nFrederica should accompany her, for the benefit of masters, but we\noverruled her there. Frederica was wretched in the idea of going, and I\ncould not bear to have her at the mercy of her mother; not all the\nmasters in London could compensate for the ruin of her comfort. I\nshould have feared, too, for her health, and for everything but her\nprinciples—there I believe she is not to be injured by her mother, or\nher mother’s friends; but with those friends she must have mixed (a\nvery bad set, I doubt not), or have been left in total solitude, and I\ncan hardly tell which would have been worse for her. If she is with her\nmother, moreover, she must, alas! in all probability be with Reginald,\nand that would be the greatest evil of all. Here we shall in time be in\npeace, and our regular employments, our books and conversations, with\nexercise, the children, and every domestic pleasure in my power to\nprocure her, will, I trust, gradually overcome this youthful\nattachment. I should not have a doubt of it were she slighted for any\nother woman in the world than her own mother. How long Lady Susan will\nbe in town, or whether she returns here again, I know not. I could not\nbe cordial in my invitation, but if she chuses to come no want of\ncordiality on my part will keep her away. I could not help asking\nReginald if he intended being in London this winter, as soon as I found\nher ladyship’s steps would be bent thither; and though he professed\nhimself quite undetermined, there was something in his look and voice\nas he spoke which contradicted his words. I have done with lamentation;\nI look upon the event as so far decided that I resign myself to it in\ndespair. If he leaves you soon for London everything will be concluded.\n\nYour affectionate, &c.,\nC. VERNON."

Mr. Johnson has hit on the most\neffectual manner of plaguing us all. He had heard, I imagine, by some\nmeans or other, that you were soon to be in London, and immediately\ncontrived to have such an attack of the gout as must at least delay his\njourney to Bath, if not wholly prevent it. I am persuaded the gout is\nbrought on or kept off at pleasure; it was the same when I wanted to\njoin the Hamiltons to the Lakes; and three years ago, when _I_ had a\nfancy for Bath, nothing could induce him to have a gouty symptom.\n\nI am pleased to find that my letter had so much effect on you, and that\nDe Courcy is certainly your own. Let me hear from you as soon as you\narrive, and in particular tell me what you mean to do with Mainwaring.\nIt is impossible to say when I shall be able to come to you; my\nconfinement must be great. It is such an abominable trick to be ill\nhere instead of at Bath that I can scarcely command myself at all. At\nBath his old aunts would have nursed him, but here it all falls upon\nme; and he bears pain with such patience that I have not the common\nexcuse for losing my temper.\n\nYours ever,\nALICIA."

To have you confined as nurse in his apartment! My dear\nAlicia, of what a mistake were you guilty in marrying a man of his age!\njust old enough to be formal, ungovernable, and to have the gout; too\nold to be agreeable, too young to die. I arrived last night about five,\nhad scarcely swallowed my dinner when Mainwaring made his appearance. I\nwill not dissemble what real pleasure his sight afforded me, nor how\nstrongly I felt the contrast between his person and manners and those\nof Reginald, to the infinite disadvantage of the latter. For an hour or\ntwo I was even staggered in my resolution of marrying him, and though\nthis was too idle and nonsensical an idea to remain long on my mind, I\ndo not feel very eager for the conclusion of my marriage, nor look\nforward with much impatience to the time when Reginald, according to\nour agreement, is to be in town. I shall probably put off his arrival\nunder some pretence or other. He must not come till Mainwaring is gone.\nI am still doubtful at times as to marrying; if the old man would die I\nmight not hesitate, but a state of dependance on the caprice of Sir\nReginald will not suit the freedom of my spirit; and if I resolve to\nwait for that event, I shall have excuse enough at present in having\nbeen scarcely ten months a widow. I have not given Mainwaring any hint\nof my intention, or allowed him to consider my acquaintance with\nReginald as more than the commonest flirtation, and he is tolerably\nappeased. Adieu, till we meet; I am enchanted with my lodgings.\n\nYours ever,\nS. VERNON."

      "text": "_Lady Susan Vernon to Mr. De Courcy._\n\n\nUpper Seymour Street.\n\n\nI have received your letter, and though I do not attempt to conceal\nthat I am gratified by your impatience for the hour of meeting, I yet\nfeel myself under the necessity of delaying that hour beyond the time\noriginally fixed. Do not think me unkind for such an exercise of my\npower, nor accuse me of instability without first hearing my reasons.\nIn the course of my journey from Churchhill I had ample leisure for\nreflection on the present state of our affairs, and every review has\nserved to convince me that they require a delicacy and cautiousness of\nconduct to which we have hitherto been too little attentive. We have\nbeen hurried on by our feelings to a degree of precipitation which ill\naccords with the claims of our friends or the opinion of the world. We\nhave been unguarded in forming this hasty engagement, but we must not\ncomplete the imprudence by ratifying it while there is so much reason\nto fear the connection would be opposed by those friends on whom you\ndepend. It is not for us to blame any expectations on your father’s\nside of your marrying to advantage; where possessions are so extensive\nas those of your family, the wish of increasing them, if not strictly\nreasonable, is too common to excite surprize or resentment. He has a\nright to require a woman of fortune in his daughter-in-law, and I am\nsometimes quarrelling with myself for suffering you to form a\nconnection so imprudent; but the influence of reason is often\nacknowledged too late by those who feel like me. I have now been but a\nfew months a widow, and, however little indebted to my husband’s memory\nfor any happiness derived from him during a union of some years, I\ncannot forget that the indelicacy of so early a second marriage must\nsubject me to the censure of the world, and incur, what would be still\nmore insupportable, the displeasure of Mr. Vernon. I might perhaps\nharden myself in time against the injustice of general reproach, but\nthe loss of _his_ valued esteem I am, as you well know, ill-fitted to\nendure; and when to this may be added the consciousness of having\ninjured you with your family, how am I to support myself? With feelings\nso poignant as mine, the conviction of having divided the son from his\nparents would make me, even with you, the most miserable of beings. It\nwill surely, therefore, be advisable to delay our union—to delay it\ntill appearances are more promising—till affairs have taken a more\nfavourable turn. To assist us in such a resolution I feel that absence\nwill be necessary. We must not meet. Cruel as this sentence may appear,\nthe necessity of pronouncing it, which can alone reconcile it to\nmyself, will be evident to you when you have considered our situation\nin the light in which I have found myself imperiously obliged to place\nit. You may be—you must be—well assured that nothing but the strongest\nconviction of duty could induce me to wound my own feelings by urging a\nlengthened separation, and of insensibility to yours you will hardly\nsuspect me. Again, therefore, I say that we ought not, we must not, yet\nmeet. By a removal for some months from each other we shall\ntranquillise the sisterly fears of Mrs. Vernon, who, accustomed herself\nto the enjoyment of riches, considers fortune as necessary everywhere,\nand whose sensibilities are not of a nature to comprehend ours. Let me\nhear from you soon—very soon. Tell me that you submit to my arguments,\nand do not reproach me for using such. I cannot bear reproaches: my\nspirits are not so high as to need being repressed. I must endeavour to\nseek amusement, and fortunately many of my friends are in town; amongst\nthem the Mainwarings; you know how sincerely I regard both husband and\nwife.\n\nI am, very faithfully yours,\nS.

      "text": "_Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy._\n\n\nChurchhill.\n\n\nMy dear Mother,—Your letter has surprized me beyond measure! Can it be\ntrue that they are really separated—and for ever? I should be overjoyed\nif I dared depend on it, but after all that I have seen how can one be\nsecure? And Reginald really with you! My surprize is the greater\nbecause on Wednesday, the very day of his coming to Parklands, we had a\nmost unexpected and unwelcome visit from Lady Susan, looking all\ncheerfulness and good-humour, and seeming more as if she were to marry\nhim when she got to London than as if parted from him for ever. She\nstayed nearly two hours, was as affectionate and agreeable as ever, and\nnot a syllable, not a hint was dropped, of any disagreement or coolness\nbetween them. I asked her whether she had seen my brother since his\narrival in town; not, as you may suppose, with any doubt of the fact,\nbut merely to see how she looked. She immediately answered, without any\nembarrassment, that he had been kind enough to call on her on Monday;\nbut she believed he had already returned home, which I was very far\nfrom crediting. Your kind invitation is accepted by us with pleasure,\nand on Thursday next we and our little ones will be with you. Pray\nheaven, Reginald may not be in town again by that time! I wish we could\nbring dear Frederica too, but I am sorry to say that her mother’s\nerrand hither was to fetch her away; and, miserable as it made the poor\ngirl, it was impossible to detain her. I was thoroughly unwilling to\nlet her go, and so was her uncle; and all that could be urged we did\nurge; but Lady Susan declared that as she was now about to fix herself\nin London for several months, she could not be easy if her daughter\nwere not with her for masters, &c. Her manner, to be sure, was very\nkind and proper, and Mr. Vernon believes that Frederica will now be\ntreated with affection. I wish I could think so too. The poor girl’s\nheart was almost broke at taking leave of us. I charged her to write to\nme very often, and to remember that if she were in any distress we\nshould be always her friends. I took care to see her alone, that I\nmight say all this, and I hope made her a little more comfortable; but\nI shall not be easy till I can go to town and judge of her situation\nmyself. I wish there were a better prospect than now appears of the\nmatch which the conclusion of your letter declares your expectations\nof. At present, it is not very likely.\n\nYours ever, &c.,\nC. VERNON."

      "chapter": "Conclusion",
      "text": "This correspondence, by a meeting between some of the parties, and a\nseparation between the others, could not, to the great detriment of the\nPost Office revenue, be continued any longer. Very little assistance to\nthe State could be derived from the epistolary intercourse of Mrs.\nVernon and her niece; for the former soon perceived, by the style of\nFrederica’s letters, that they were written under her mother’s\ninspection! and therefore, deferring all particular enquiry till she\ncould make it personally in London, ceased writing minutely or often.\nHaving learnt enough, in the meanwhile, from her open-hearted brother,\nof what had passed between him and Lady Susan to sink the latter lower\nthan ever in her opinion, she was proportionably more anxious to get\nFrederica removed from such a mother, and placed under her own care;\nand, though with little hope of success, was resolved to leave nothing\nunattempted that might offer a chance of obtaining her sister-in-law’s\nconsent to it. Her anxiety on the subject made her press for an early\nvisit to London; and Mr. Vernon, who, as it must already have appeared,\nlived only to do whatever he was desired, soon found some accommodating\nbusiness to call him thither. With a heart full of the matter, Mrs.\nVernon waited on Lady Susan shortly after her arrival in town, and was\nmet with such an easy and cheerful affection, as made her almost turn\nfrom her with horror. No remembrance of Reginald, no consciousness of\nguilt, gave one look of embarrassment; she was in excellent spirits,\nand seemed eager to show at once by every possible attention to her\nbrother and sister her sense of their kindness, and her pleasure in\ntheir society. Frederica was no more altered than Lady Susan; the same\nrestrained manners, the same timid look in the presence of her mother\nas heretofore, assured her aunt of her situation being uncomfortable,\nand confirmed her in the plan of altering it. No unkindness, however,\non the part of Lady Susan appeared. Persecution on the subject of Sir\nJames was entirely at an end; his name merely mentioned to say that he\nwas not in London; and indeed, in all her conversation, she was\nsolicitous only for the welfare and improvement of her daughter,\nacknowledging, in terms of grateful delight, that Frederica was now\ngrowing every day more and more what a parent could desire. Mrs.\nVernon, surprized and incredulous, knew not what to suspect, and,\nwithout any change in her own views, only feared greater difficulty in\naccomplishing them. The first hope of anything better was derived from\nLady Susan’s asking her whether she thought Frederica looked quite as\nwell as she had done at Churchhill, as she must confess herself to have\nsometimes an anxious doubt of London’s perfectly agreeing with her.\nMrs. Vernon, encouraging the doubt, directly proposed her niece’s\nreturning with them into the country. Lady Susan was unable to express\nher sense of such kindness, yet knew not, from a variety of reasons,\nhow to part with her daughter; and as, though her own plans were not\nyet wholly fixed, she trusted it would ere long be in her power to take\nFrederica into the country herself, concluded by declining entirely to\nprofit by such unexampled attention. Mrs. Vernon persevered, however,\nin the offer of it, and though Lady Susan continued to resist, her\nresistance in the course of a few days seemed somewhat less formidable.\nThe lucky alarm of an influenza decided what might not have been\ndecided quite so soon. Lady Susan’s maternal fears were then too much\nawakened for her to think of anything but Frederica’s removal from the\nrisk of infection; above all disorders in the world she most dreaded\nthe influenza for her daughter’s constitution!\n\nFrederica returned to Churchhill with her uncle and aunt; and three\nweeks afterwards, Lady Susan announced her being married to Sir James\nMartin. Mrs. Vernon was then convinced of what she had only suspected\nbefore, that she might have spared herself all the trouble of urging a\nremoval which Lady Susan had doubtless resolved on from the first.\nFrederica’s visit was nominally for six weeks, but her mother, though\ninviting her to return in one or two affectionate letters, was very\nready to oblige the whole party by consenting to a prolongation of her\nstay, and in the course of two months ceased to write of her absence,\nand in the course of two more to write to her at all. Frederica was\ntherefore fixed in the family of her uncle and aunt till such time as\nReginald De Courcy could be talked, flattered, and finessed into an\naffection for her which, allowing leisure for the conquest of his\nattachment to her mother, for his abjuring all future attachments, and\ndetesting the sex, might be reasonably looked for in the course of a\ntwelvemonth. Three months might have done it in general, but Reginald’s\nfeelings were no less lasting than lively. Whether Lady Susan was or\nwas not happy in her second choice, I do not see how it can ever be\nascertained; for who would take her assurance of it on either side of\nthe question? The world must judge from probabilities; she had nothing\nagainst her but her husband, and her conscience. Sir James may seem to\nhave drawn a harder lot than mere folly merited; I leave him,\ntherefore, to all the pity that anybody can give him. For myself, I\nconfess that _I_ can pity only Miss Mainwaring; who, coming to town,\nand putting herself to an expense in clothes which impoverished her for\ntwo years, on purpose to secure him, was defrauded of her due by a\nwoman ten years older than herself."
