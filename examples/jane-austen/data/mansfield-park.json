    "text": "About thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward, of Huntingdon, with only seven\nthousand pounds, had the good luck to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram, of\nMansfield Park, in the county of Northampton, and to be thereby raised\nto the rank of a baronet’s lady, with all the comforts and consequences\nof an handsome house and large income. All Huntingdon exclaimed on the\ngreatness of the match, and her uncle, the lawyer, himself, allowed her\nto be at least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to\nit. She had two sisters to be benefited by her elevation; and such of\ntheir acquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss Frances quite as\nhandsome as Miss Maria, did not scruple to predict their marrying with\nalmost equal advantage. But there certainly are not so many men of\nlarge fortune in the world as there are pretty women to deserve them.\nMiss Ward, at the end of half a dozen years, found herself obliged to\nbe attached to the Rev. Mr. Norris, a friend of her brother-in-law,\nwith scarcely any private fortune, and Miss Frances fared yet worse.\nMiss Ward’s match, indeed, when it came to the point, was not\ncontemptible: Sir Thomas being happily able to give his friend an\nincome in the living of Mansfield; and Mr. and Mrs. Norris began their\ncareer of conjugal felicity with very little less than a thousand a\nyear. But Miss Frances married, in the common phrase, to disoblige her\nfamily, and by fixing on a lieutenant of marines, without education,\nfortune, or connexions, did it very thoroughly. She could hardly have\nmade a more untoward choice. Sir Thomas Bertram had interest, which,\nfrom principle as well as pride—from a general wish of doing right, and\na desire of seeing all that were connected with him in situations of\nrespectability, he would have been glad to exert for the advantage of\nLady Bertram’s sister; but her husband’s profession was such as no\ninterest could reach; and before he had time to devise any other method\nof assisting them, an absolute breach between the sisters had taken\nplace. It was the natural result of the conduct of each party, and such\nas a very imprudent marriage almost always produces. To save herself\nfrom useless remonstrance, Mrs. Price never wrote to her family on the\nsubject till actually married. Lady Bertram, who was a woman of very\ntranquil feelings, and a temper remarkably easy and indolent, would\nhave contented herself with merely giving up her sister, and thinking\nno more of the matter; but Mrs. Norris had a spirit of activity, which\ncould not be satisfied till she had written a long and angry letter to\nFanny, to point out the folly of her conduct, and threaten her with all\nits possible ill consequences. Mrs. Price, in her turn, was injured and\nangry; and an answer, which comprehended each sister in its bitterness,\nand bestowed such very disrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir\nThomas as Mrs. Norris could not possibly keep to herself, put an end to\nall intercourse between them for a considerable period."

    "text": "Their homes were so distant, and the circles in which they moved so\ndistinct, as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each\nother’s existence during the eleven following years, or, at least, to\nmake it very wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have\nit in her power to tell them, as she now and then did, in an angry\nvoice, that Fanny had got another child. By the end of eleven years,\nhowever, Mrs. Price could no longer afford to cherish pride or\nresentment, or to lose one connexion that might possibly assist her. A\nlarge and still increasing family, an husband disabled for active\nservice, but not the less equal to company and good liquor, and a very\nsmall income to supply their wants, made her eager to regain the\nfriends she had so carelessly sacrificed; and she addressed Lady\nBertram in a letter which spoke so much contrition and despondence,\nsuch a superfluity of children, and such a want of almost everything\nelse, as could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation. She was\npreparing for her ninth lying-in; and after bewailing the circumstance,\nand imploring their countenance as sponsors to the expected child, she\ncould not conceal how important she felt they might be to the future\nmaintenance of the eight already in being. Her eldest was a boy of ten\nyears old, a fine spirited fellow, who longed to be out in the world;\nbut what could she do? Was there any chance of his being hereafter\nuseful to Sir Thomas in the concerns of his West Indian property? No\nsituation would be beneath him; or what did Sir Thomas think of\nWoolwich? or how could a boy be sent out to the East?"

Mrs. Norris was\noften observing to the others that she could not get her poor sister\nand her family out of her head, and that, much as they had all done for\nher, she seemed to be wanting to do more; and at length she could not\nbut own it to be her wish that poor Mrs. Price should be relieved from\nthe charge and expense of one child entirely out of her great number.\n“What if they were among them to undertake the care of her eldest\ndaughter, a girl now nine years old, of an age to require more\nattention than her poor mother could possibly give? The trouble and\nexpense of it to them would be nothing, compared with the benevolence\nof the action.” Lady Bertram agreed with her instantly. “I think we\ncannot do better,” said she; “let us send for the child.”"

He thought of his own four\nchildren, of his two sons, of cousins in love, etc.;—but no sooner had\nhe deliberately begun to state his objections, than Mrs. Norris\ninterrupted him with a reply to them all, whether stated or not."

Having no children of my own, who should I\nlook to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow, but the\nchildren of my sisters?—and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just—but you\nknow I am a woman of few words and professions. Do not let us be\nfrightened from a good deed by a trifle. Give a girl an education, and\nintroduce her properly into the world, and ten to one but she has the\nmeans of settling well, without farther expense to anybody. A niece of\nours, Sir Thomas, I may say, or at least of _yours_, would not grow up\nin this neighbourhood without many advantages. I don’t say she would be\nso handsome as her cousins. I dare say she would not; but she would be\nintroduced into the society of this country under such very favourable\ncircumstances as, in all human probability, would get her a creditable\nestablishment. You are thinking of your sons—but do not you know that,\nof all things upon earth, _that_ is the least likely to happen, brought\nup as they would be, always together like brothers and sisters? It is\nmorally impossible. I never knew an instance of it. It is, in fact, the\nonly sure way of providing against the connexion. Suppose her a pretty\ngirl, and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence,\nand I dare say there would be mischief. The very idea of her having\nbeen suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and\nneglect, would be enough to make either of the dear, sweet-tempered\nboys in love with her. But breed her up with them from this time, and\nsuppose her even to have the beauty of an angel, and she will never be\nmore to either than a sister.”"

Is not she a\nsister’s child? and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit of\nbread to give her? My dear Sir Thomas, with all my faults I have a warm\nheart; and, poor as I am, would rather deny myself the necessaries of\nlife than do an ungenerous thing. So, if you are not against it, I will\nwrite to my poor sister tomorrow, and make the proposal; and, as soon\nas matters are settled, _I_ will engage to get the child to Mansfield;\n_you_ shall have no trouble about it. My own trouble, you know, I never\nregard. I will send Nanny to London on purpose, and she may have a bed\nat her cousin the saddler’s, and the child be appointed to meet her\nthere.

    "text": "Except to the attack on Nanny’s cousin, Sir Thomas no longer made any\nobjection, and a more respectable, though less economical rendezvous\nbeing accordingly substituted, everything was considered as settled,\nand the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed. The\ndivision of gratifying sensations ought not, in strict justice, to have\nbeen equal; for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real and\nconsistent patron of the selected child, and Mrs. Norris had not the\nleast intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance. As\nfar as walking, talking, and contriving reached, she was thoroughly\nbenevolent, and nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others;\nbut her love of money was equal to her love of directing, and she knew\nquite as well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends.\nHaving married on a narrower income than she had been used to look\nforward to, she had, from the first, fancied a very strict line of\neconomy necessary; and what was begun as a matter of prudence, soon\ngrew into a matter of choice, as an object of that needful solicitude\nwhich there were no children to supply. Had there been a family to\nprovide for, Mrs. Norris might never have saved her money; but having\nno care of that kind, there was nothing to impede her frugality, or\nlessen the comfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they\nhad never lived up to. Under this infatuating principle, counteracted\nby no real affection for her sister, it was impossible for her to aim\nat more than the credit of projecting and arranging so expensive a\ncharity; though perhaps she might so little know herself as to walk\nhome to the Parsonage, after this conversation, in the happy belief of\nbeing the most liberal-minded sister and aunt in the world."

He had been\nconsidering her as a particularly welcome addition at the Parsonage, as\na desirable companion to an aunt who had no children of her own; but he\nfound himself wholly mistaken. Mrs. Norris was sorry to say that the\nlittle girl’s staying with them, at least as things then were, was\nquite out of the question. Poor Mr. Norris’s indifferent state of\nhealth made it an impossibility: he could no more bear the noise of a\nchild than he could fly; if, indeed, he should ever get well of his\ngouty complaints, it would be a different matter: she should then be\nglad to take her turn, and think nothing of the inconvenience; but just\nnow, poor Mr. Norris took up every moment of her time, and the very\nmention of such a thing she was sure would distract him."

There\nwere in fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny. Julia\nBertram was only twelve, and Maria but a year older. The little visitor\nmeanwhile was as unhappy as possible. Afraid of everybody, ashamed of\nherself, and longing for the home she had left, she knew not how to\nlook up, and could scarcely speak to be heard, or without crying. Mrs.\nNorris had been talking to her the whole way from Northampton of her\nwonderful good fortune, and the extraordinary degree of gratitude and\ngood behaviour which it ought to produce, and her consciousness of\nmisery was therefore increased by the idea of its being a wicked thing\nfor her not to be happy. The fatigue, too, of so long a journey, became\nsoon no trifling evil. In vain were the well-meant condescensions of\nSir Thomas, and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that\nshe would be a good girl; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her\nsit on the sofa with herself and pug, and vain was even the sight of a\ngooseberry tart towards giving her comfort; she could scarcely swallow\ntwo mouthfuls before tears interrupted her, and sleep seeming to be her\nlikeliest friend, she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed."

She was disheartened by Lady\nBertram’s silence, awed by Sir Thomas’s grave looks, and quite overcome\nby Mrs. Norris’s admonitions. Her elder cousins mortified her by\nreflections on her size, and abashed her by noticing her shyness: Miss\nLee wondered at her ignorance, and the maid-servants sneered at her\nclothes; and when to these sorrows was added the idea of the brothers\nand sisters among whom she had always been important as playfellow,\ninstructress, and nurse, the despondence that sunk her little heart was\nsevere."

Edmund’s\nfriendship never failed her: his leaving Eton for Oxford made no change\nin his kind dispositions, and only afforded more frequent opportunities\nof proving them. Without any display of doing more than the rest, or\nany fear of doing too much, he was always true to her interests, and\nconsiderate of her feelings, trying to make her good qualities\nunderstood, and to conquer the diffidence which prevented their being\nmore apparent; giving her advice, consolation, and encouragement."

You have robbed Edmund for ten,\ntwenty, thirty years, perhaps for life, of more than half the income\nwhich ought to be his. It may hereafter be in my power, or in yours (I\nhope it will), to procure him better preferment; but it must not be\nforgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his\nnatural claims on us, and that nothing can, in fact, be an equivalent\nfor the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the\nurgency of your debts.”"

The spare rooms at the Parsonage had never been\nwanted, but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend was now\nnever forgotten. Not all her precautions, however, could save her from\nbeing suspected of something better; or, perhaps, her very display of\nthe importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose\nit really intended for Fanny.

Mrs. Norris could not help\nthinking that some steady old thing might be found among the numbers\nbelonging to the Park that would do vastly well; or that one might be\nborrowed of the steward; or that perhaps Dr. Grant might now and then\nlend them the pony he sent to the post. She could not but consider it\nas absolutely unnecessary, and even improper, that Fanny should have a\nregular lady’s horse of her own, in the style of her cousins. She was\nsure Sir Thomas had never intended it: and she must say that, to be\nmaking such a purchase in his absence, and adding to the great expenses\nof his stable, at a time when a large part of his income was unsettled,\nseemed to her very unjustifiable. “Fanny must have a horse,” was\nEdmund’s only reply. Mrs. Norris could not see it in the same light.\nLady Bertram did: she entirely agreed with her son as to the necessity\nof it, and as to its being considered necessary by his father; she only\npleaded against there being any hurry; she only wanted him to wait till\nSir Thomas’s return, and then Sir Thomas might settle it all himself.\nHe would be at home in September, and where would be the harm of only\nwaiting till September?"

The new mare proved a\ntreasure; with a very little trouble she became exactly calculated for\nthe purpose, and Fanny was then put in almost full possession of her.\nShe had not supposed before that anything could ever suit her like the\nold grey pony; but her delight in Edmund’s mare was far beyond any\nformer pleasure of the sort; and the addition it was ever receiving in\nthe consideration of that kindness from which her pleasure sprung, was\nbeyond all her words to express.

Tom arrived\nsafely, bringing an excellent account of his father’s health; but to\nvery little purpose, as far as Mrs. Norris was concerned. Sir Thomas’s\nsending away his son seemed to her so like a parent’s care, under the\ninfluence of a foreboding of evil to himself, that she could not help\nfeeling dreadful presentiments; and as the long evenings of autumn came\non, was so terribly haunted by these ideas, in the sad solitariness of\nher cottage, as to be obliged to take daily refuge in the dining-room\nof the Park. The return of winter engagements, however, was not without\nits effect; and in the course of their progress, her mind became so\npleasantly occupied in superintending the fortunes of her eldest niece,\nas tolerably to quiet her nerves. “If poor Sir Thomas were fated never\nto return, it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria\nwell married,” she very often thought; always when they were in the\ncompany of men of fortune, and particularly on the introduction of a\nyoung man who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and\nfinest places in the country."

He only conditioned that\nthe marriage should not take place before his return, which he was\nagain looking eagerly forward to.

    "text": "Such was the state of affairs in the month of July; and Fanny had just\nreached her eighteenth year, when the society of the village received\nan addition in the brother and sister of Mrs. Grant, a Mr. and Miss\nCrawford, the children of her mother by a second marriage. They were\nyoung people of fortune. The son had a good estate in Norfolk, the\ndaughter twenty thousand pounds. As children, their sister had been\nalways very fond of them; but, as her own marriage had been soon\nfollowed by the death of their common parent, which left them to the\ncare of a brother of their father, of whom Mrs. Grant knew nothing, she\nhad scarcely seen them since. In their uncle’s house they had found a\nkind home. Admiral and Mrs. Crawford, though agreeing in nothing else,\nwere united in affection for these children, or, at least, were no\nfarther adverse in their feelings than that each had their favourite,\nto whom they showed the greatest fondness of the two. The Admiral\ndelighted in the boy, Mrs. Crawford doted on the girl; and it was the\nlady’s death which now obliged her _protegee_, after some months’\nfurther trial at her uncle’s house, to find another home. Admiral\nCrawford was a man of vicious conduct, who chose, instead of retaining\nhis niece, to bring his mistress under his own roof; and to this Mrs.\nGrant was indebted for her sister’s proposal of coming to her, a\nmeasure quite as welcome on one side as it could be expedient on the\nother; for Mrs. Grant, having by this time run through the usual\nresources of ladies residing in the country without a family of\nchildren—having more than filled her favourite sitting-room with pretty\nfurniture, and made a choice collection of plants and poultry—was very\nmuch in want of some variety at home. The arrival, therefore, of a\nsister whom she had always loved, and now hoped to retain with her as\nlong as she remained single, was highly agreeable; and her chief\nanxiety was lest Mansfield should not satisfy the habits of a young\nwoman who had been mostly used to London."

To\nanything like a permanence of abode, or limitation of society, Henry\nCrawford had, unluckily, a great dislike: he could not accommodate his\nsister in an article of such importance; but he escorted her, with the\nutmost kindness, into Northamptonshire, and as readily engaged to fetch\nher away again, at half an hour’s notice, whenever she were weary of\nthe place."

Mary Crawford was\nremarkably pretty; Henry, though not handsome, had air and countenance;\nthe manners of both were lively and pleasant, and Mrs. Grant\nimmediately gave them credit for everything else. She was delighted\nwith each, but Mary was her dearest object; and having never been able\nto glory in beauty of her own, she thoroughly enjoyed the power of\nbeing proud of her sister’s. She had not waited her arrival to look out\nfor a suitable match for her: she had fixed on Tom Bertram; the eldest\nson of a baronet was not too good for a girl of twenty thousand pounds,\nwith all the elegance and accomplishments which Mrs. Grant foresaw in\nher; and being a warm-hearted, unreserved woman, Mary had not been\nthree hours in the house before she told her what she had planned."

She\nacknowledged, however, that the Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men,\nthat two such young men were not often seen together even in London,\nand that their manners, particularly those of the eldest, were very\ngood. _He_ had been much in London, and had more liveliness and\ngallantry than Edmund, and must, therefore, be preferred; and, indeed,\nhis being the eldest was another strong claim. She had felt an early\npresentiment that she _should_ like the eldest best. She knew it was\nher way."

Miss Crawford soon felt\nthat he and his situation might do. She looked about her with due\nconsideration, and found almost everything in his favour: a park, a\nreal park, five miles round, a spacious modern-built house, so well\nplaced and well screened as to deserve to be in any collection of\nengravings of gentlemen’s seats in the kingdom, and wanting only to be\ncompletely new furnished—pleasant sisters, a quiet mother, and an\nagreeable man himself—with the advantage of being tied up from much\ngaming at present by a promise to his father, and of being Sir Thomas\nhereafter. It might do very well; she believed she should accept him;\nand she began accordingly to interest herself a little about the horse\nwhich he had to run at the B—— races."

Few young ladies of eighteen could\nbe less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny. In a quiet way,\nvery little attended to, she paid her tribute of admiration to Miss\nCrawford’s beauty; but as she still continued to think Mr. Crawford\nvery plain, in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the\ncontrary, she never mentioned _him_. The notice, which she excited\nherself, was to this effect. “I begin now to understand you all, except\nMiss Price,” said Miss Crawford, as she was walking with the Mr.\nBertrams. “Pray, is she out, or is she not? I am puzzled. She dined at\nthe Parsonage, with the rest of you, which seemed like being _out_; and\nyet she says so little, that I can hardly suppose she _is_.”"

A girl not out\nhas always the same sort of dress: a close bonnet, for instance; looks\nvery demure, and never says a word. You may smile, but it is so, I\nassure you; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far,\nit is all very proper. Girls should be quiet and modest. The most\nobjectionable part is, that the alteration of manners on being\nintroduced into company is frequently too sudden. They sometimes pass\nin such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite—to\nconfidence! _That_ is the faulty part of the present system. One does\nnot like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to\nevery thing—and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the\nyear before.

My friend\nSneyd—you have heard me speak of Sneyd, Edmund—his father, and mother,\nand sisters, were there, all new to me. When we reached Albion Place\nthey were out; we went after them, and found them on the pier: Mrs. and\nthe two Miss Sneyds, with others of their acquaintance. I made my bow\nin form; and as Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded by men, attached myself to\none of her daughters, walked by her side all the way home, and made\nmyself as agreeable as I could; the young lady perfectly easy in her\nmanners, and as ready to talk as to listen. I had not a suspicion that\nI could be doing anything wrong.

It would be a very\nflat business, she was sure. In comparison with his brother, Edmund\nwould have nothing to say. The soup would be sent round in a most\nspiritless manner, wine drank without any smiles or agreeable trifling,\nand the venison cut up without supplying one pleasant anecdote of any\nformer haunch, or a single entertaining story, about “my friend such a\none.” She must try to find amusement in what was passing at the upper\nend of the table, and in observing Mr. Rushworth, who was now making\nhis appearance at Mansfield for the first time since the Crawfords’\narrival. He had been visiting a friend in the neighbouring county, and\nthat friend having recently had his grounds laid out by an improver,\nMr. Rushworth was returned with his head full of the subject, and very\neager to be improving his own place in the same way; and though not\nsaying much to the purpose, could talk of nothing else. The subject had\nbeen already handled in the drawing-room; it was revived in the\ndining-parlour. Miss Bertram’s attention and opinion was evidently his\nchief aim; and though her deportment showed rather conscious\nsuperiority than any solicitude to oblige him, the mention of Sotherton\nCourt, and the ideas attached to it, gave her a feeling of complacency,\nwhich prevented her from being very ungracious."

It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt\nanything where I am now, with my little half acre. It would be quite a\nburlesque. But if I had more room, I should take a prodigious delight\nin improving and planting. We did a vast deal in that way at the\nParsonage: we made it quite a different place from what it was when we\nfirst had it. You young ones do not remember much about it, perhaps;\nbut if dear Sir Thomas were here, he could tell you what improvements\nwe made: and a great deal more would have been done, but for poor Mr.\nNorris’s sad state of health. He could hardly ever get out, poor man,\nto enjoy anything, and _that_ disheartened me from doing several things\nthat Sir Thomas and I used to talk of. If it had not been for _that_,\nwe should have carried on the garden wall, and made the plantation to\nshut out the churchyard, just as Dr. Grant has done. We were always\ndoing something as it was.

There have been two\nor three fine old trees cut down, that grew too near the house, and it\nopens the prospect amazingly, which makes me think that Repton, or\nanybody of that sort, would certainly have the avenue at Sotherton\ndown: the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill,\nyou know,” turning to Miss Bertram particularly as he spoke.

The season, the scene, the air, were\nall favourable to tenderness and sentiment. Mrs. Grant and her tambour\nframe were not without their use: it was all in harmony; and as\neverything will turn to account when love is once set going, even the\nsandwich tray, and Dr. Grant doing the honours of it, were worth\nlooking at. Without studying the business, however, or knowing what he\nwas about, Edmund was beginning, at the end of a week of such\nintercourse, to be a good deal in love; and to the credit of the lady\nit may be added that, without his being a man of the world or an elder\nbrother, without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small\ntalk, he began to be agreeable to her. She felt it to be so, though she\nhad not foreseen, and could hardly understand it; for he was not\npleasant by any common rule: he talked no nonsense; he paid no\ncompliments; his opinions were unbending, his attentions tranquil and\nsimple. There was a charm, perhaps, in his sincerity, his steadiness,\nhis integrity, which Miss Crawford might be equal to feel, though not\nequal to discuss with herself. She did not think very much about it,\nhowever: he pleased her for the present; she liked to have him near\nher; it was enough."

She was a\nlittle surprised that he could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford,\nand not see more of the sort of fault which he had already observed,\nand of which _she_ was almost always reminded by a something of the\nsame nature whenever she was in her company; but so it was. Edmund was\nfond of speaking to her of Miss Crawford, but he seemed to think it\nenough that the Admiral had since been spared; and she scrupled to\npoint out her own remarks to him, lest it should appear like\nill-nature. The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her\nwas the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride, which the\nformer caught, soon after her being settled at Mansfield, from the\nexample of the young ladies at the Park, and which, when Edmund’s\nacquaintance with her increased, led to his encouraging the wish, and\nthe offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts,\nas the best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish. No\npain, no injury, however, was designed by him to his cousin in this\noffer: _she_ was not to lose a day’s exercise by it. The mare was only\nto be taken down to the Parsonage half an hour before her ride were to\nbegin; and Fanny, on its being first proposed, so far from feeling\nslighted, was almost over-powered with gratitude that he should be\nasking her leave for it."

The second\nday’s trial was not so guiltless. Miss Crawford’s enjoyment of riding\nwas such that she did not know how to leave off. Active and fearless,\nand though rather small, strongly made, she seemed formed for a\nhorsewoman; and to the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise, something\nwas probably added in Edmund’s attendance and instructions, and\nsomething more in the conviction of very much surpassing her sex in\ngeneral by her early progress, to make her unwilling to dismount.

A happy party\nit appeared to her, all interested in one object: cheerful beyond a\ndoubt, for the sound of merriment ascended even to her. It was a sound\nwhich did not make _her_ cheerful; she wondered that Edmund should\nforget her, and felt a pang. She could not turn her eyes from the\nmeadow; she could not help watching all that passed. At first Miss\nCrawford and her companion made the circuit of the field, which was not\nsmall, at a foot’s pace; then, at _her_ apparent suggestion, they rose\ninto a canter; and to Fanny’s timid nature it was most astonishing to\nsee how well she sat. After a few minutes they stopped entirely. Edmund\nwas close to her; he was speaking to her; he was evidently directing\nher management of the bridle; he had hold of her hand; she saw it, or\nthe imagination supplied what the eye could not reach. She must not\nwonder at all this; what could be more natural than that Edmund should\nbe making himself useful, and proving his good-nature by any one? She\ncould not but think, indeed, that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved\nhim the trouble; that it would have been particularly proper and\nbecoming in a brother to have done it himself; but Mr. Crawford, with\nall his boasted good-nature, and all his coachmanship, probably knew\nnothing of the matter, and had no active kindness in comparison of\nEdmund. She began to think it rather hard upon the mare to have such\ndouble duty; if she were forgotten, the poor mare should be remembered."

A successful scheme of\nthis sort generally brings on another; and the having been to Mansfield\nCommon disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after. There\nwere many other views to be shewn; and though the weather was hot,\nthere were shady lanes wherever they wanted to go. A young party is\nalways provided with a shady lane. Four fine mornings successively were\nspent in this manner, in shewing the Crawfords the country, and doing\nthe honours of its finest spots. Everything answered; it was all gaiety\nand good-humour, the heat only supplying inconvenience enough to be\ntalked of with pleasure—till the fourth day, when the happiness of one\nof the party was exceedingly clouded. Miss Bertram was the one. Edmund\nand Julia were invited to dine at the Parsonage, and _she_ was\nexcluded. It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant, with perfect\ngood-humour, on Mr. Rushworth’s account, who was partly expected at the\nPark that day; but it was felt as a very grievous injury, and her good\nmanners were severely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she\nreached home. As Mr. Rushworth did _not_ come, the injury was\nincreased, and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over\nhim; she could only be sullen to her mother, aunt, and cousin, and\nthrow as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert."

That was the only point of resemblance\nbetween her and the lady who sat by her: in everything but a value for\nEdmund, Miss Crawford was very unlike her. She had none of Fanny’s\ndelicacy of taste, of mind, of feeling; she saw Nature, inanimate\nNature, with little observation; her attention was all for men and\nwomen, her talents for the light and lively. In looking back after\nEdmund, however, when there was any stretch of road behind them, or\nwhen he gained on them in ascending a considerable hill, they were\nunited, and a “there he is” broke at the same moment from them both,\nmore than once."

Cannot you imagine\nwith what unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of\nRushworth did many a time repair to this chapel? The young Mrs.\nEleanors and Mrs. Bridgets—starched up into seeming piety, but with\nheads full of something very different—especially if the poor chaplain\nwere not worth looking at—and, in those days, I fancy parsons were very\ninferior even to what they are now.”"

All were attracted at first by\nthe plants or the pheasants, and all dispersed about in happy\nindependence. Mr. Crawford was the first to move forward to examine the\ncapabilities of that end of the house. The lawn, bounded on each side\nby a high wall, contained beyond the first planted area a\nbowling-green, and beyond the bowling-green a long terrace walk, backed\nby iron palisades, and commanding a view over them into the tops of the\ntrees of the wilderness immediately adjoining. It was a good spot for\nfault-finding. Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr.\nRushworth; and when, after a little time, the others began to form into\nparties, these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by\nEdmund, Miss Crawford, and Fanny, who seemed as naturally to unite, and\nwho, after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties,\nleft them and walked on. The remaining three, Mrs. Rushworth, Mrs.\nNorris, and Julia, were still far behind; for Julia, whose happy star\nno longer prevailed, was obliged to keep by the side of Mrs. Rushworth,\nand restrain her impatient feet to that lady’s slow pace, while her\naunt, having fallen in with the housekeeper, who was come out to feed\nthe pheasants, was lingering behind in gossip with her. Poor Julia, the\nonly one out of the nine not tolerably satisfied with their lot, was\nnow in a state of complete penance, and as different from the Julia of\nthe barouche-box as could well be imagined. The politeness which she\nhad been brought up to practise as a duty made it impossible for her to\nescape; while the want of that higher species of self-command, that\njust consideration of others, that knowledge of her own heart, that\nprinciple of right, which had not formed any essential part of her\neducation, made her miserable under it."

A fine preacher is followed and admired; but it is not in\nfine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish\nand his neighbourhood, where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size\ncapable of knowing his private character, and observing his general\nconduct, which in London can rarely be the case. The clergy are lost\nthere in the crowds of their parishioners. They are known to the\nlargest part only as preachers. And with regard to their influencing\npublic manners, Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me, or suppose I\nmean to call them the arbiters of good-breeding, the regulators of\nrefinement and courtesy, the masters of the ceremonies of life. The\n_manners_ I speak of might rather be called _conduct_, perhaps, the\nresult of good principles; the effect, in short, of those doctrines\nwhich it is their duty to teach and recommend; and it will, I believe,\nbe everywhere found, that as the clergy are, or are not what they ought\nto be, so are the rest of the nation.”"

Miss Crawford, on walking up with her\nbrother to spend the evening at Mansfield Park, heard the good news;\nand though seeming to have no concern in the affair beyond politeness,\nand to have vented all her feelings in a quiet congratulation, heard it\nwith an attention not so easily satisfied. Mrs. Norris gave the\nparticulars of the letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea,\nas Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny\nlooking out on a twilight scene, while the Miss Bertrams, Mr.\nRushworth, and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the\npianoforte, she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group,\nand saying, “How happy Mr. Rushworth looks!

The approach of September brought tidings of Mr.\nBertram, first in a letter to the gamekeeper and then in a letter to\nEdmund; and by the end of August he arrived himself, to be gay,\nagreeable, and gallant again as occasion served, or Miss Crawford\ndemanded; to tell of races and Weymouth, and parties and friends, to\nwhich she might have listened six weeks before with some interest, and\naltogether to give her the fullest conviction, by the power of actual\ncomparison, of her preferring his younger brother."

He went for a fortnight—a fortnight of such\ndullness to the Miss Bertrams as ought to have put them both on their\nguard, and made even Julia admit, in her jealousy of her sister, the\nabsolute necessity of distrusting his attentions, and wishing him not\nto return; and a fortnight of sufficient leisure, in the intervals of\nshooting and sleeping, to have convinced the gentleman that he ought to\nkeep longer away, had he been more in the habit of examining his own\nmotives, and of reflecting to what the indulgence of his idle vanity\nwas tending; but, thoughtless and selfish from prosperity and bad\nexample, he would not look beyond the present moment. The sisters,\nhandsome, clever, and encouraging, were an amusement to his sated mind;\nand finding nothing in Norfolk to equal the social pleasures of\nMansfield, he gladly returned to it at the time appointed, and was\nwelcomed thither quite as gladly by those whom he came to trifle with\nfurther."

Each sister believed herself the favourite. Julia might be\njustified in so doing by the hints of Mrs. Grant, inclined to credit\nwhat she wished, and Maria by the hints of Mr. Crawford himself.\nEverything returned into the same channel as before his absence; his\nmanners being to each so animated and agreeable as to lose no ground\nwith either, and just stopping short of the consistence, the\nsteadiness, the solicitude, and the warmth which might excite general\nnotice."

As it was, however,\nshe only hazarded a hint, and the hint was lost. “I am rather\nsurprised,” said she, “that Mr. Crawford should come back again so\nsoon, after being here so long before, full seven weeks; for I had\nunderstood he was so very fond of change and moving about, that I\nthought something would certainly occur, when he was once gone, to take\nhim elsewhere.

Listening and wondering were all\nsuspended for a time, for Mr. Bertram was in the room again; and though\nfeeling it would be a great honour to be asked by him, she thought it\nmust happen. He came towards their little circle; but instead of asking\nher to dance, drew a chair near her, and gave her an account of the\npresent state of a sick horse, and the opinion of the groom, from whom\nhe had just parted. Fanny found that it was not to be, and in the\nmodesty of her nature immediately felt that she had been unreasonable\nin expecting it. When he had told of his horse, he took a newspaper\nfrom the table, and looking over it, said in a languid way, “If you\nwant to dance, Fanny, I will stand up with you.” With more than equal\ncivility the offer was declined; she did not wish to dance. “I am glad\nof it,” said he, in a much brisker tone, and throwing down the\nnewspaper again, “for I am tired to death. I only wonder how the good\npeople can keep it up so long. They had need be _all_ in love, to find\nany amusement in such folly; and so they are, I fancy. If you look at\nthem you may see they are so many couple of lovers—all but Yates and\nMrs. Grant—and, between ourselves, she, poor woman, must want a lover\nas much as any one of them. A desperate dull life hers must be with the\ndoctor,” making a sly face as he spoke towards the chair of the latter,\nwho proving, however, to be close at his elbow, made so instantaneous a\nchange of expression and subject necessary, as Fanny, in spite of\neverything, could hardly help laughing at. “A strange business this in\nAmerica, Dr. Grant!

He came on the wings of disappointment, and with\nhis head full of acting, for it had been a theatrical party; and the\nplay in which he had borne a part was within two days of\nrepresentation, when the sudden death of one of the nearest connexions\nof the family had destroyed the scheme and dispersed the performers.

The play had been Lovers’ Vows, and Mr. Yates was to have been\nCount Cassel. “A trifling part,” said he, “and not at all to my taste,\nand such a one as I certainly would not accept again; but I was\ndetermined to make no difficulties. Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had\nappropriated the only two characters worth playing before I reached\nEcclesford; and though Lord Ravenshaw offered to resign his to me, it\nwas impossible to take it, you know. I was sorry for _him_ that he\nshould have so mistaken his powers, for he was no more equal to the\nBaron—a little man with a weak voice, always hoarse after the first ten\nminutes. It must have injured the piece materially; but _I_ was\nresolved to make no difficulties.

I was surprised\nto see Sir Henry such a stick. Luckily the strength of the piece did\nnot depend upon him. Our Agatha was inimitable, and the duke was\nthought very great by many.

The thought returned again and again. “Oh for\nthe Ecclesford theatre and scenery to try something with.” Each sister\ncould echo the wish; and Henry Crawford, to whom, in all the riot of\nhis gratifications it was yet an untasted pleasure, was quite alive at\nthe idea. “I really believe,” said he, “I could be fool enough at this\nmoment to undertake any character that ever was written, from Shylock\nor Richard III down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat\nand cocked hat. I feel as if I could be anything or everything; as if I\ncould rant and storm, or sigh or cut capers, in any tragedy or comedy\nin the English language. Let us be doing something. Be it only half a\nplay, an act, a scene; what should prevent us? Not these countenances,\nI am sure,” looking towards the Miss Bertrams; “and for a theatre, what\nsignifies a theatre? We shall be only amusing ourselves. Any room in\nthis house might suffice.”"

All\nthe best plays were run over in vain. Neither Hamlet, nor Macbeth, nor\nOthello, nor Douglas, nor The Gamester, presented anything that could\nsatisfy even the tragedians; and The Rivals, The School for Scandal,\nWheel of Fortune, Heir at Law, and a long et cetera, were successively\ndismissed with yet warmer objections. No piece could be proposed that\ndid not supply somebody with a difficulty, and on one side or the other\nit was a continual repetition of, “Oh no, _that_ will never do! Let us\nhave no ranting tragedies. Too many characters. Not a tolerable woman’s\npart in the play. Anything but _that_, my dear Tom. It would be\nimpossible to fill it up. One could not expect anybody to take such a\npart. Nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end. _That_ might do,\nperhaps, but for the low parts. If I _must_ give my opinion, I have\nalways thought it the most insipid play in the English language. _I_ do\nnot wish to make objections; I shall be happy to be of any use, but I\nthink we could not chuse worse.”"

Everybody was growing weary of\nindecision, and the first idea with everybody was, that nothing had\nbeen proposed before so likely to suit them all. Mr. Yates was\nparticularly pleased: he had been sighing and longing to do the Baron\nat Ecclesford, had grudged every rant of Lord Ravenshaw’s, and been\nforced to re-rant it all in his own room. The storm through Baron\nWildenheim was the height of his theatrical ambition; and with the\nadvantage of knowing half the scenes by heart already, he did now, with\nthe greatest alacrity, offer his services for the part. To do him\njustice, however, he did not resolve to appropriate it; for remembering\nthat there was some very good ranting-ground in Frederick, he professed\nan equal willingness for that. Henry Crawford was ready to take either.\nWhichever Mr. Yates did not chuse would perfectly satisfy him, and a\nshort parley of compliment ensued. Miss Bertram, feeling all the\ninterest of an Agatha in the question, took on her to decide it, by\nobserving to Mr. Yates that this was a point in which height and figure\nought to be considered, and that _his_ being the tallest, seemed to fit\nhim peculiarly for the Baron. She was acknowledged to be quite right,\nand the two parts being accepted accordingly, she was certain of the\nproper Frederick. Three of the characters were now cast, besides Mr.\nRushworth, who was always answered for by Maria as willing to do\nanything; when Julia, meaning, like her sister, to be Agatha, began to\nbe scrupulous on Miss Crawford’s account."

I cannot but\nsuppose you _will_ when you have read it carefully over. Read only the\nfirst act aloud to either your mother or aunt, and see how you can\napprove it. It will not be necessary to send you to your _father’s_\njudgment, I am convinced.”"

I do not know the play; but, as\nMaria says, if there is anything a little too warm (and it is so with\nmost of them) it can be easily left out. We must not be over-precise,\nEdmund. As Mr. Rushworth is to act too, there can be no harm. I only\nwish Tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began, for there\nwas the loss of half a day’s work about those side-doors. The curtain\nwill be a good job, however. The maids do their work very well, and I\nthink we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings. There is\nno occasion to put them so very close together. I _am_ of some use, I\nhope, in preventing waste and making the most of things. There should\nalways be one steady head to superintend so many young ones. I forgot\nto tell Tom of something that happened to me this very day. I had been\nlooking about me in the poultry-yard, and was just coming out, when who\nshould I see but Dick Jackson making up to the servants’ hall-door with\ntwo bits of deal board in his hand, bringing them to father, you may be\nsure; mother had chanced to send him of a message to father, and then\nfather had bid him bring up them two bits of board, for he could not no\nhow do without them. I knew what all this meant, for the servants’\ndinner-bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads; and as I\nhate such encroaching people (the Jacksons are very encroaching, I have\nalways said so: just the sort of people to get all they can), I said to\nthe boy directly (a great lubberly fellow of ten years old, you know,\nwho ought to be ashamed of himself), ‘_I’ll_ take the boards to your\nfather, Dick, so get you home again as fast as you can.’ The boy looked\nvery silly, and turned away without offering a word, for I believe I\nmight speak pretty sharp; and I dare say it will cure him of coming\nmarauding about the house for one while. I hate such greediness—so good\nas your father is to the family, employing the man all the year round!”"

Her\nentreaty had no effect on Tom: he only said again what he had said\nbefore; and it was not merely Tom, for the requisition was now backed\nby Maria, and Mr. Crawford, and Mr. Yates, with an urgency which\ndiffered from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious, and\nwhich altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny; and before she could\nbreathe after it, Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing\nher in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here\nis about nothing: I am quite ashamed of you, Fanny, to make such a\ndifficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort—so kind as\nthey are to you! Take the part with a good grace, and let us hear no\nmore of the matter, I entreat.”"

    "text": "It was not in Miss Crawford’s power to talk Fanny into any real\nforgetfulness of what had passed. When the evening was over, she went\nto bed full of it, her nerves still agitated by the shock of such an\nattack from her cousin Tom, so public and so persevered in, and her\nspirits sinking under her aunt’s unkind reflection and reproach. To be\ncalled into notice in such a manner, to hear that it was but the\nprelude to something so infinitely worse, to be told that she must do\nwhat was so impossible as to act; and then to have the charge of\nobstinacy and ingratitude follow it, enforced with such a hint at the\ndependence of her situation, had been too distressing at the time to\nmake the remembrance when she was alone much less so, especially with\nthe superadded dread of what the morrow might produce in continuation\nof the subject. Miss Crawford had protected her only for the time; and\nif she were applied to again among themselves with all the\nauthoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of, and Edmund\nperhaps away, what should she do? She fell asleep before she could\nanswer the question, and found it quite as puzzling when she awoke the\nnext morning. The little white attic, which had continued her\nsleeping-room ever since her first entering the family, proving\nincompetent to suggest any reply, she had recourse, as soon as she was\ndressed, to another apartment more spacious and more meet for walking\nabout in and thinking, and of which she had now for some time been\nalmost equally mistress. It had been their school-room; so called till\nthe Miss Bertrams would not allow it to be called so any longer, and\ninhabited as such to a later period. There Miss Lee had lived, and\nthere they had read and written, and talked and laughed, till within\nthe last three years, when she had quitted them. The room had then\nbecome useless, and for some time was quite deserted, except by Fanny,\nwhen she visited her plants, or wanted one of the books, which she was\nstill glad to keep there, from the deficiency of space and\naccommodation in her little chamber above: but gradually, as her value\nfor the comforts of it increased, she had added to her possessions, and\nspent more of her time there; and having nothing to oppose her, had so\nnaturally and so artlessly worked herself into it, that it was now\ngenerally admitted to be hers. The East room, as it had been called\never since Maria Bertram was sixteen, was now considered Fanny’s,\nalmost as decidedly as the white attic: the smallness of the one making\nthe use of the other so evidently reasonable that the Miss Bertrams,\nwith every superiority in their own apartments which their own sense of\nsuperiority could demand, were entirely approving it; and Mrs. Norris,\nhaving stipulated for there never being a fire in it on Fanny’s\naccount, was tolerably resigned to her having the use of what nobody\nelse wanted, though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of the\nindulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in the house."

The comfort of it in\nher hours of leisure was extreme. She could go there after anything\nunpleasant below, and find immediate consolation in some pursuit, or\nsome train of thought at hand. Her plants, her books—of which she had\nbeen a collector from the first hour of her commanding a shilling—her\nwriting-desk, and her works of charity and ingenuity, were all within\nher reach; or if indisposed for employment, if nothing but musing would\ndo, she could scarcely see an object in that room which had not an\ninteresting remembrance connected with it. Everything was a friend, or\nbore her thoughts to a friend; and though there had been sometimes much\nof suffering to her; though her motives had often been misunderstood,\nher feelings disregarded, and her comprehension undervalued; though she\nhad known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almost\nevery recurrence of either had led to something consolatory: her aunt\nBertram had spoken for her, or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what\nwas yet more frequent or more dear, Edmund had been her champion and\nher friend: he had supported her cause or explained her meaning, he had\ntold her not to cry, or had given her some proof of affection which\nmade her tears delightful; and the whole was now so blended together,\nso harmonised by distance, that every former affliction had its charm.\nThe room was most dear to her, and she would not have changed its\nfurniture for the handsomest in the house, though what had been\noriginally plain had suffered all the ill-usage of children; and its\ngreatest elegancies and ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia’s\nwork, too ill done for the drawing-room, three transparencies, made in\na rage for transparencies, for the three lower panes of one window,\nwhere Tintern Abbey held its station between a cave in Italy and a\nmoonlight lake in Cumberland, a collection of family profiles, thought\nunworthy of being anywhere else, over the mantelpiece, and by their\nside, and pinned against the wall, a small sketch of a ship sent four\nyears ago from the Mediterranean by William, with H.M.S. Antwerp at the\nbottom, in letters as tall as the mainmast."

But she had more\nthan fears of her own perseverance to remove: she had begun to feel\nundecided as to what she _ought_ _to_ _do_; and as she walked round the\nroom her doubts were increasing. Was she _right_ in refusing what was\nso warmly asked, so strongly wished for—what might be so essential to a\nscheme on which some of those to whom she owed the greatest\ncomplaisance had set their hearts? Was it not ill-nature, selfishness,\nand a fear of exposing herself? And would Edmund’s judgment, would his\npersuasion of Sir Thomas’s disapprobation of the whole, be enough to\njustify her in a determined denial in spite of all the rest? It would\nbe so horrible to her to act that she was inclined to suspect the truth\nand purity of her own scruples; and as she looked around her, the\nclaims of her cousins to being obliged were strengthened by the sight\nof present upon present that she had received from them. The table\nbetween the windows was covered with work-boxes and netting-boxes which\nhad been given her at different times, principally by Tom; and she grew\nbewildered as to the amount of the debt which all these kind\nremembrances produced. A tap at the door roused her in the midst of\nthis attempt to find her way to her duty, and her gentle “Come in” was\nanswered by the appearance of one, before whom all her doubts were wont\nto be laid. Her eyes brightened at the sight of Edmund."

One\nadvantage resulted from it to Fanny: at the earnest request of Miss\nCrawford, Mrs. Grant had, with her usual good-humour, agreed to\nundertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted; and this was all\nthat occurred to gladden _her_ heart during the day; and even this,\nwhen imparted by Edmund, brought a pang with it, for it was Miss\nCrawford to whom she was obliged—it was Miss Crawford whose kind\nexertions were to excite her gratitude, and whose merit in making them\nwas spoken of with a glow of admiration. She was safe; but peace and\nsafety were unconnected here. Her mind had been never farther from\npeace. She could not feel that she had done wrong herself, but she was\ndisquieted in every other way. Her heart and her judgment were equally\nagainst Edmund’s decision: she could not acquit his unsteadiness, and\nhis happiness under it made her wretched. She was full of jealousy and\nagitation. Miss Crawford came with looks of gaiety which seemed an\ninsult, with friendly expressions towards herself which she could\nhardly answer calmly. Everybody around her was gay and busy, prosperous\nand important; each had their object of interest, their part, their\ndress, their favourite scene, their friends and confederates: all were\nfinding employment in consultations and comparisons, or diversion in\nthe playful conceits they suggested. She alone was sad and\ninsignificant: she had no share in anything; she might go or stay; she\nmight be in the midst of their noise, or retreat from it to the\nsolitude of the East room, without being seen or missed. She could\nalmost think anything would have been preferable to this. Mrs. Grant\nwas of consequence: _her_ good-nature had honourable mention; her taste\nand her time were considered; her presence was wanted; she was sought\nfor, and attended, and praised; and Fanny was at first in some danger\nof envying her the character she had accepted. But reflection brought\nbetter feelings, and shewed her that Mrs. Grant was entitled to\nrespect, which could never have belonged to _her_; and that, had she\nreceived even the greatest, she could never have been easy in joining a\nscheme which, considering only her uncle, she must condemn altogether."

    "text": "From this moment there was a return of his former jealousy, which\nMaria, from increasing hopes of Crawford, was at little pains to\nremove; and the chances of Mr. Rushworth’s ever attaining to the\nknowledge of his two-and-forty speeches became much less. As to his\never making anything _tolerable_ of them, nobody had the smallest idea\nof that except his mother; _she_, indeed, regretted that his part was\nnot more considerable, and deferred coming over to Mansfield till they\nwere forward enough in their rehearsal to comprehend all his scenes;\nbut the others aspired at nothing beyond his remembering the catchword,\nand the first line of his speech, and being able to follow the prompter\nthrough the rest. Fanny, in her pity and kindheartedness, was at great\npains to teach him how to learn, giving him all the helps and\ndirections in her power, trying to make an artificial memory for him,\nand learning every word of his part herself, but without his being much\nthe forwarder."

The gloom of her first\nanticipations was proved to have been unfounded. She was occasionally\nuseful to all; she was perhaps as much at peace as any."

I have been slaving myself\ntill I can hardly stand, to contrive Mr. Rushworth’s cloak without\nsending for any more satin; and now I think you may give me your help\nin putting it together.

She had been\nquite overlooked by her cousins; and as her own opinion of her claims\non Sir Thomas’s affection was much too humble to give her any idea of\nclassing herself with his children, she was glad to remain behind and\ngain a little breathing-time. Her agitation and alarm exceeded all that\nwas endured by the rest, by the right of a disposition which not even\ninnocence could keep from suffering. She was nearly fainting: all her\nformer habitual dread of her uncle was returning, and with it\ncompassion for him and for almost every one of the party on the\ndevelopment before him, with solicitude on Edmund’s account\nindescribable. She had found a seat, where in excessive trembling she\nwas enduring all these fearful thoughts, while the other three, no\nlonger under any restraint, were giving vent to their feelings of\nvexation, lamenting over such an unlooked-for premature arrival as a\nmost untoward event, and without mercy wishing poor Sir Thomas had been\ntwice as long on his passage, or were still in Antigua."

The ruin of the play was to them a certainty: they felt the\ntotal destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand; while Mr.\nYates considered it only as a temporary interruption, a disaster for\nthe evening, and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal\nbeing renewed after tea, when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were\nover, and he might be at leisure to be amused by it. The Crawfords\nlaughed at the idea; and having soon agreed on the propriety of their\nwalking quietly home and leaving the family to themselves, proposed Mr.\nYates’s accompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage.\nBut Mr. Yates, having never been with those who thought much of\nparental claims, or family confidence, could not perceive that anything\nof the kind was necessary; and therefore, thanking them, said, “he\npreferred remaining where he was, that he might pay his respects to the\nold gentleman handsomely since he _was_ come; and besides, he did not\nthink it would be fair by the others to have everybody run away.”"

As she entered, her own name caught her ear.\nSir Thomas was at that moment looking round him, and saying, “But where\nis Fanny? Why do not I see my little Fanny?”—and on perceiving her,\ncame forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her,\ncalling her his dear Fanny, kissing her affectionately, and observing\nwith decided pleasure how much she was grown! Fanny knew not how to\nfeel, nor where to look. She was quite oppressed. He had never been so\nkind, so _very_ kind to her in his life. His manner seemed changed, his\nvoice was quick from the agitation of joy; and all that had been awful\nin his dignity seemed lost in tenderness. He led her nearer the light\nand looked at her again—inquired particularly after her health, and\nthen, correcting himself, observed that he need not inquire, for her\nappearance spoke sufficiently on that point. A fine blush having\nsucceeded the previous paleness of her face, he was justified in his\nbelief of her equal improvement in health and beauty. He inquired next\nafter her family, especially William: and his kindness altogether was\nsuch as made her reproach herself for loving him so little, and\nthinking his return a misfortune; and when, on having courage to lift\nher eyes to his face, she saw that he was grown thinner, and had the\nburnt, fagged, worn look of fatigue and a hot climate, every tender\nfeeling was increased, and she was miserable in considering how much\nunsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him."

His business in Antigua had\nlatterly been prosperously rapid, and he came directly from Liverpool,\nhaving had an opportunity of making his passage thither in a private\nvessel, instead of waiting for the packet; and all the little\nparticulars of his proceedings and events, his arrivals and departures,\nwere most promptly delivered, as he sat by Lady Bertram and looked with\nheartfelt satisfaction on the faces around him—interrupting himself\nmore than once, however, to remark on his good fortune in finding them\nall at home—coming unexpectedly as he did—all collected together\nexactly as he could have wished, but dared not depend on. Mr. Rushworth\nwas not forgotten: a most friendly reception and warmth of hand-shaking\nhad already met him, and with pointed attention he was now included in\nthe objects most intimately connected with Mansfield. There was nothing\ndisagreeable in Mr. Rushworth’s appearance, and Sir Thomas was liking\nhim already."

It\nhad left her nothing to do. Instead of being sent for out of the room,\nand seeing him first, and having to spread the happy news through the\nhouse, Sir Thomas, with a very reasonable dependence, perhaps, on the\nnerves of his wife and children, had sought no confidant but the\nbutler, and had been following him almost instantaneously into the\ndrawing-room. Mrs. Norris felt herself defrauded of an office on which\nshe had always depended, whether his arrival or his death were to be\nthe thing unfolded; and was now trying to be in a bustle without having\nanything to bustle about, and labouring to be important where nothing\nwas wanted but tranquillity and silence. Would Sir Thomas have\nconsented to eat, she might have gone to the housekeeper with\ntroublesome directions, and insulted the footmen with injunctions of\ndespatch; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all dinner: he would take\nnothing, nothing till tea came—he would rather wait for tea. Still Mrs.\nNorris was at intervals urging something different; and in the most\ninteresting moment of his passage to England, when the alarm of a\nFrench privateer was at the height, she burst through his recital with\nthe proposal of soup. “Sure, my dear Sir Thomas, a basin of soup would\nbe a much better thing for you than tea. Do have a basin of soup.”"

Sir Thomas had been a good\ndeal surprised to find candles burning in his room; and on casting his\neye round it, to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general\nair of confusion in the furniture. The removal of the bookcase from\nbefore the billiard-room door struck him especially, but he had\nscarcely more than time to feel astonished at all this, before there\nwere sounds from the billiard-room to astonish him still farther. Some\none was talking there in a very loud accent; he did not know the\nvoice—more than talking—almost hallooing. He stepped to the door,\nrejoicing at that moment in having the means of immediate\ncommunication, and, opening it, found himself on the stage of a\ntheatre, and opposed to a ranting young man, who appeared likely to\nknock him down backwards. At the very moment of Yates perceiving Sir\nThomas, and giving perhaps the very best start he had ever given in the\nwhole course of his rehearsals, Tom Bertram entered at the other end of\nthe room; and never had he found greater difficulty in keeping his\ncountenance. His father’s looks of solemnity and amazement on this his\nfirst appearance on any stage, and the gradual metamorphosis of the\nimpassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well-bred and easy Mr. Yates,\nmaking his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram, was such an\nexhibition, such a piece of true acting, as he would not have lost upon\nany account. It would be the last—in all probability—the last scene on\nthat stage; but he was sure there could not be a finer. The house would\nclose with the greatest eclat."

Not\nless acutely was it felt by Fanny, who had edged back her chair behind\nher aunt’s end of the sofa, and, screened from notice herself, saw all\nthat was passing before her.

He could not help\ngiving Mrs. Norris a hint of his having hoped that her advice might\nhave been interposed to prevent what her judgment must certainly have\ndisapproved. The young people had been very inconsiderate in forming\nthe plan; they ought to have been capable of a better decision\nthemselves; but they were young; and, excepting Edmund, he believed, of\nunsteady characters; and with greater surprise, therefore, he must\nregard her acquiescence in their wrong measures, her countenance of\ntheir unsafe amusements, than that such measures and such amusements\nshould have been suggested. Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as\nnearly being silenced as ever she had been in her life; for she was\nashamed to confess having never seen any of the impropriety which was\nso glaring to Sir Thomas, and would not have admitted that her\ninfluence was insufficient—that she might have talked in vain. Her only\nresource was to get out of the subject as fast as possible, and turn\nthe current of Sir Thomas’s ideas into a happier channel. She had a\ngreat deal to insinuate in her own praise as to _general_ attention to\nthe interest and comfort of his family, much exertion and many\nsacrifices to glance at in the form of hurried walks and sudden\nremovals from her own fireside, and many excellent hints of distrust\nand economy to Lady Bertram and Edmund to detail, whereby a most\nconsiderable saving had always arisen, and more than one bad servant\nbeen detected. But her chief strength lay in Sotherton. Her greatest\nsupport and glory was in having formed the connexion with the\nRushworths. _There_ she was impregnable. She took to herself all the\ncredit of bringing Mr. Rushworth’s admiration of Maria to any effect.\n“If I had not been active,” said she, “and made a point of being\nintroduced to his mother, and then prevailed on my sister to pay the\nfirst visit, I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have come\nof it; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who\nwants a great deal of encouragement, and there were girls enough on the\ncatch for him if we had been idle. But I left no stone unturned. I was\nready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister, and at last I did\npersuade her. You know the distance to Sotherton; it was in the middle\nof winter, and the roads almost impassable, but I did persuade her.”"

I cured him at last; but he was very bad all the winter—and\nthis was such a day, I could not help going to him up in his room\nbefore we set off to advise him not to venture: he was putting on his\nwig; so I said, ‘Coachman, you had much better not go; your Lady and I\nshall be very safe; you know how steady Stephen is, and Charles has\nbeen upon the leaders so often now, that I am sure there is no fear.’\nBut, however, I soon found it would not do; he was bent upon going, and\nas I hate to be worrying and officious, I said no more; but my heart\nquite ached for him at every jolt, and when we got into the rough lanes\nabout Stoke, where, what with frost and snow upon beds of stones, it\nwas worse than anything you can imagine, I was quite in an agony about\nhim. And then the poor horses too! To see them straining away! You know\nhow I always feel for the horses. And when we got to the bottom of\nSandcroft Hill, what do you think I did? You will laugh at me; but I\ngot out and walked up. I did indeed. It might not be saving them much,\nbut it was something, and I could not bear to sit at my ease and be\ndragged up at the expense of those noble animals.

Maria was in a\ngood deal of agitation. It was of the utmost consequence to her that\nCrawford should now lose no time in declaring himself, and she was\ndisturbed that even a day should be gone by without seeming to advance\nthat point. She had been expecting to see him the whole morning, and\nall the evening, too, was still expecting him. Mr. Rushworth had set\noff early with the great news for Sotherton; and she had fondly hoped\nfor such an immediate _eclaircissement_ as might save him the trouble\nof ever coming back again. But they had seen no one from the Parsonage,\nnot a creature, and had heard no tidings beyond a friendly note of\ncongratulation and inquiry from Mrs. Grant to Lady Bertram. It was the\nfirst day for many, many weeks, in which the families had been wholly\ndivided. Four-and-twenty hours had never passed before, since August\nbegan, without bringing them together in some way or other. It was a\nsad, anxious day; and the morrow, though differing in the sort of evil,\ndid by no means bring less. A few moments of feverish enjoyment were\nfollowed by hours of acute suffering. Henry Crawford was again in the\nhouse: he walked up with Dr. Grant, who was anxious to pay his respects\nto Sir Thomas, and at rather an early hour they were ushered into the\nbreakfast-room, where were most of the family. Sir Thomas soon\nappeared, and Maria saw with delight and agitation the introduction of\nthe man she loved to her father. Her sensations were indefinable, and\nso were they a few minutes afterwards upon hearing Henry Crawford, who\nhad a chair between herself and Tom, ask the latter in an undervoice\nwhether there were any plans for resuming the play after the present\nhappy interruption (with a courteous glance at Sir Thomas), because, in\nthat case, he should make a point of returning to Mansfield at any time\nrequired by the party: he was going away immediately, being to meet his\nuncle at Bath without delay; but if there were any prospect of a\nrenewal of Lovers’ Vows, he should hold himself positively engaged, he\nshould break through every other claim, he should absolutely condition\nwith his uncle for attending them whenever he might be wanted. The play\nshould not be lost by _his_ absence."

There was never much laughing in his presence; or, if\nthere is any difference, it is not more, I think, than such an absence\nhas a tendency to produce at first. There must be a sort of shyness;\nbut I cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry,\nexcept when my uncle was in town. No young people’s are, I suppose,\nwhen those they look up to are at home”."

A civil servant she had withstood; but when Dr. Grant\nhimself went out with an umbrella, there was nothing to be done but to\nbe very much ashamed, and to get into the house as fast as possible;\nand to poor Miss Crawford, who had just been contemplating the dismal\nrain in a very desponding state of mind, sighing over the ruin of all\nher plan of exercise for that morning, and of every chance of seeing a\nsingle creature beyond themselves for the next twenty-four hours, the\nsound of a little bustle at the front door, and the sight of Miss Price\ndripping with wet in the vestibule, was delightful. The value of an\nevent on a wet day in the country was most forcibly brought before her.\nShe was all alive again directly, and among the most active in being\nuseful to Fanny, in detecting her to be wetter than she would at first\nallow, and providing her with dry clothes; and Fanny, after being\nobliged to submit to all this attention, and to being assisted and\nwaited on by mistresses and maids, being also obliged, on returning\ndownstairs, to be fixed in their drawing-room for an hour while the\nrain continued, the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was\nthus extended to Miss Crawford, and might carry on her spirits to the\nperiod of dressing and dinner."

As to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such\nweather might occasion at home, she had nothing to suffer on that\nscore; for as her being out was known only to her two aunts, she was\nperfectly aware that none would be felt, and that in whatever cottage\naunt Norris might chuse to establish her during the rain, her being in\nsuch cottage would be indubitable to aunt Bertram."

To Fanny herself it appeared a very simple and\nnatural circumstance. She had scarcely ever been at the Parsonage since\nthe instrument’s arrival, there had been no reason that she should; but\nMiss Crawford, calling to mind an early expressed wish on the subject,\nwas concerned at her own neglect; and “Shall I play to you now?” and\n“What will you have?” were questions immediately following with the\nreadiest good-humour."

Fanny went to\nher every two or three days: it seemed a kind of fascination: she could\nnot be easy without going, and yet it was without loving her, without\never thinking like her, without any sense of obligation for being\nsought after now when nobody else was to be had; and deriving no higher\npleasure from her conversation than occasional amusement, and _that_\noften at the expense of her judgment, when it was raised by pleasantry\non people or subjects which she wished to be respected. She went,\nhowever, and they sauntered about together many an half-hour in Mrs.\nGrant’s shrubbery, the weather being unusually mild for the time of\nyear, and venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches\nnow comparatively unsheltered, remaining there perhaps till, in the\nmidst of some tender ejaculation of Fanny’s on the sweets of so\nprotracted an autumn, they were forced, by the sudden swell of a cold\ngust shaking down the last few yellow leaves about them, to jump up and\nwalk for warmth."

How wonderful, how very wonderful the operations of time, and\nthe changes of the human mind!” And following the latter train of\nthought, she soon afterwards added: “If any one faculty of our nature\nmay be called _more_ wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory.\nThere seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers,\nthe failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our\nintelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so\nobedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so\ntyrannic, so beyond control!

She was soon aware of this herself; for\nthough she must submit, as her own propriety of mind directed, in spite\nof her aunt Norris’s opinion, to being the principal lady in company,\nand to all the little distinctions consequent thereon, she found, while\nthey were at table, such a happy flow of conversation prevailing, in\nwhich she was not required to take any part—there was so much to be\nsaid between the brother and sister about Bath, so much between the two\nyoung men about hunting, so much of politics between Mr. Crawford and\nDr. Grant, and of everything and all together between Mr. Crawford and\nMrs. Grant, as to leave her the fairest prospect of having only to\nlisten in quiet, and of passing a very agreeable day. She could not\ncompliment the newly arrived gentleman, however, with any appearance of\ninterest, in a scheme for extending his stay at Mansfield, and sending\nfor his hunters from Norfolk, which, suggested by Dr. Grant, advised by\nEdmund, and warmly urged by the two sisters, was soon in possession of\nhis mind, and which he seemed to want to be encouraged even by her to\nresolve on. Her opinion was sought as to the probable continuance of\nthe open weather, but her answers were as short and indifferent as\ncivility allowed.

Children of the\nsame family, the same blood, with the same first associations and\nhabits, have some means of enjoyment in their power, which no\nsubsequent connexions can supply; and it must be by a long and\nunnatural estrangement, by a divorce which no subsequent connexion can\njustify, if such precious remains of the earliest attachments are ever\nentirely outlived. Too often, alas! it is so. Fraternal love, sometimes\nalmost everything, is at others worse than nothing. But with William\nand Fanny Price it was still a sentiment in all its prime and\nfreshness, wounded by no opposition of interest, cooled by no separate\nattachment, and feeling the influence of time and absence only in its\nincrease."

The place deserves it, and you will\nfind yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of.\n(Excuse me, your ladyship must not see your cards. There, let them lie\njust before you.) The place deserves it, Bertram. You talk of giving it\nthe air of a gentleman’s residence. _That_ will be done by the removal\nof the farmyard; for, independent of that terrible nuisance, I never\nsaw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a\ngentleman’s residence, so much the look of a something above a mere\nparsonage-house—above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year. It is\nnot a scrambling collection of low single rooms, with as many roofs as\nwindows; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square\nfarmhouse: it is a solid, roomy, mansion-like looking house, such as\none might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from\ngeneration to generation, through two centuries at least, and were now\nspending from two to three thousand a year in.” Miss Crawford listened,\nand Edmund agreed to this. “The air of a gentleman’s residence,\ntherefore, you cannot but give it, if you do anything. But it is\ncapable of much more. (Let me see, Mary; Lady Bertram bids a dozen for\nthat queen; no, no, a dozen is more than it is worth. Lady Bertram does\nnot bid a dozen. She will have nothing to say to it. Go on, go on.) By\nsome such improvements as I have suggested (I do not really require you\nto proceed upon my plan, though, by the bye, I doubt anybody’s striking\nout a better) you may give it a higher character. You may raise it into\na _place_. From being the mere gentleman’s residence, it becomes, by\njudicious improvement, the residence of a man of education, taste,\nmodern manners, good connexions. All this may be stamped on it; and\nthat house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the\ngreat landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road;\nespecially as there is no real squire’s house to dispute the point—a\ncircumstance, between ourselves, to enhance the value of such a\nsituation in point of privilege and independence beyond all\ncalculation. _You_ think with me, I hope” (turning with a softened\nvoice to Fanny). “Have you ever seen the place?”"

She said little,\nassented only here and there, and betrayed no inclination either of\nappropriating any part of the compliment to herself, or of\nstrengthening his views in favour of Northamptonshire. Finding by whom\nhe was observed, Henry Crawford addressed himself on the same subject\nto Sir Thomas, in a more everyday tone, but still with feeling."

Edmund\nmight, in the common phrase, do the duty of Thornton, that is, he might\nread prayers and preach, without giving up Mansfield Park: he might\nride over every Sunday, to a house nominally inhabited, and go through\ndivine service; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every\nseventh day, for three or four hours, if that would content him. But it\nwill not. He knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly\nsermon can convey; and that if he does not live among his parishioners,\nand prove himself, by constant attention, their well-wisher and friend,\nhe does very little either for their good or his own.”"

    "text": "Edmund was at this time particularly full of cares: his mind being\ndeeply occupied in the consideration of two important events now at\nhand, which were to fix his fate in life—ordination and\nmatrimony—events of such a serious character as to make the ball, which\nwould be very quickly followed by one of them, appear of less moment in\nhis eyes than in those of any other person in the house. On the 23rd he\nwas going to a friend near Peterborough, in the same situation as\nhimself, and they were to receive ordination in the course of the\nChristmas week. Half his destiny would then be determined, but the\nother half might not be so very smoothly wooed. His duties would be\nestablished, but the wife who was to share, and animate, and reward\nthose duties, might yet be unattainable. He knew his own mind, but he\nwas not always perfectly assured of knowing Miss Crawford’s. There were\npoints on which they did not quite agree; there were moments in which\nshe did not seem propitious; and though trusting altogether to her\naffection, so far as to be resolved—almost resolved—on bringing it to a\ndecision within a very short time, as soon as the variety of business\nbefore him were arranged, and he knew what he had to offer her, he had\nmany anxious feelings, many doubting hours as to the result. His\nconviction of her regard for him was sometimes very strong; he could\nlook back on a long course of encouragement, and she was as perfect in\ndisinterested attachment as in everything else. But at other times\ndoubt and alarm intermingled with his hopes; and when he thought of her\nacknowledged disinclination for privacy and retirement, her decided\npreference of a London life, what could he expect but a determined\nrejection? unless it were an acceptance even more to be deprecated,\ndemanding such sacrifices of situation and employment on his side as\nconscience must forbid."

But this had occurred\non the first day of its being settled, within the first hour of the\nburst of such enjoyment, when nothing but the friends she was to visit\nwas before her. He had since heard her express herself differently,\nwith other feelings, more chequered feelings: he had heard her tell\nMrs. Grant that she should leave her with regret; that she began to\nbelieve neither the friends nor the pleasures she was going to were\nworth those she left behind; and that though she felt she must go, and\nknew she should enjoy herself when once away, she was already looking\nforward to being at Mansfield again.

Miss\nCrawford, pleased with the appeal, gave her all her best judgment and\ntaste, made everything easy by her suggestions, and tried to make\neverything agreeable by her encouragement. The dress being settled in\nall its grander parts—“But what shall you have by way of necklace?”\nsaid Miss Crawford. “Shall not you wear your brother’s cross?” And as\nshe spoke she was undoing a small parcel, which Fanny had observed in\nher hand when they met. Fanny acknowledged her wishes and doubts on\nthis point: she did not know how either to wear the cross, or to\nrefrain from wearing it. She was answered by having a small trinket-box\nplaced before her, and being requested to chuse from among several gold\nchains and necklaces. Such had been the parcel with which Miss Crawford\nwas provided, and such the object of her intended visit: and in the\nkindest manner she now urged Fanny’s taking one for the cross and to\nkeep for her sake, saying everything she could think of to obviate the\nscruples which were making Fanny start back at first with a look of\nhorror at the proposal."

Fanny\nfound herself obliged to yield, that she might not be accused of pride\nor indifference, or some other littleness; and having with modest\nreluctance given her consent, proceeded to make the selection. She\nlooked and looked, longing to know which might be least valuable; and\nwas determined in her choice at last, by fancying there was one\nnecklace more frequently placed before her eyes than the rest. It was\nof gold, prettily worked; and though Fanny would have preferred a\nlonger and a plainer chain as more adapted for her purpose, she hoped,\nin fixing on this, to be chusing what Miss Crawford least wished to\nkeep. Miss Crawford smiled her perfect approbation; and hastened to\ncomplete the gift by putting the necklace round her, and making her see\nhow well it looked. Fanny had not a word to say against its\nbecomingness, and, excepting what remained of her scruples, was\nexceedingly pleased with an acquisition so very apropos. She would\nrather, perhaps, have been obliged to some other person. But this was\nan unworthy feeling. Miss Crawford had anticipated her wants with a\nkindness which proved her a real friend. “When I wear this necklace I\nshall always think of you,” said she, “and feel how very kind you\nwere.”"

I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose\nintimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure, and in whose\ncharacters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and\nnatural delicacy as to make the few slight differences, resulting\nprincipally from situation, no reasonable hindrance to a perfect\nfriendship. I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise,” he\nrepeated, his voice sinking a little, “between the two dearest objects\nI have on earth.”"

She had never heard him speak so openly before,\nand though it told her no more than what she had long perceived, it was\na stab, for it told of his own convictions and views. They were\ndecided. He would marry Miss Crawford. It was a stab, in spite of every\nlong-standing expectation; and she was obliged to repeat again and\nagain, that she was one of his two dearest, before the words gave her\nany sensation. Could she believe Miss Crawford to deserve him, it would\nbe—oh, how different would it be—how far more tolerable! But he was\ndeceived in her: he gave her merits which she had not; her faults were\nwhat they had ever been, but he saw them no longer. Till she had shed\nmany tears over this deception, Fanny could not subdue her agitation;\nand the dejection which followed could only be relieved by the\ninfluence of fervent prayers for his happiness."

Mr. Crawford meant\nto be in town by his uncle’s accustomary late dinner-hour, and William\nwas invited to dine with him at the Admiral’s. The proposal was a very\npleasant one to William himself, who enjoyed the idea of travelling\npost with four horses, and such a good-humoured, agreeable friend; and,\nin likening it to going up with despatches, was saying at once\neverything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination\ncould suggest; and Fanny, from a different motive, was exceedingly\npleased; for the original plan was that William should go up by the\nmail from Northampton the following night, which would not have allowed\nhim an hour’s rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach; and\nthough this offer of Mr. Crawford’s would rob her of many hours of his\ncompany, she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of\nsuch a journey, to think of anything else. Sir Thomas approved of it\nfor another reason. His nephew’s introduction to Admiral Crawford might\nbe of service. The Admiral, he believed, had interest. Upon the whole,\nit was a very joyous note. Fanny’s spirits lived on it half the\nmorning, deriving some accession of pleasure from its writer being\nhimself to go away."

Miss Price, known only\nby name to half the people invited, was now to make her first\nappearance, and must be regarded as the queen of the evening. Who could\nbe happier than Miss Price? But Miss Price had not been brought up to\nthe trade of _coming_ _out_; and had she known in what light this ball\nwas, in general, considered respecting her, it would very much have\nlessened her comfort by increasing the fears she already had of doing\nwrong and being looked at. To dance without much observation or any\nextraordinary fatigue, to have strength and partners for about half the\nevening, to dance a little with Edmund, and not a great deal with Mr.\nCrawford, to see William enjoy himself, and be able to keep away from\nher aunt Norris, was the height of her ambition, and seemed to\ncomprehend her greatest possibility of happiness. As these were the\nbest of her hopes, they could not always prevail; and in the course of\na long morning, spent principally with her two aunts, she was often\nunder the influence of much less sanguine views. William, determined to\nmake this last day a day of thorough enjoyment, was out snipe-shooting;\nEdmund, she had too much reason to suppose, was at the Parsonage; and\nleft alone to bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris, who was cross because\nthe housekeeper would have her own way with the supper, and whom _she_\ncould not avoid though the housekeeper might, Fanny was worn down at\nlast to think everything an evil belonging to the ball, and when sent\noff with a parting worry to dress, moved as languidly towards her own\nroom, and felt as incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no\nshare in it."

But as it was,\nthey parted with looks on his side of grateful affection, and with some\nvery precious sensations on hers. She had felt nothing like it for\nhours. Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford’s note to William had worn\naway, she had been in a state absolutely the reverse; there had been no\ncomfort around, no hope within her. Now everything was smiling.\nWilliam’s good fortune returned again upon her mind, and seemed of\ngreater value than at first. The ball, too—such an evening of pleasure\nbefore her! It was now a real animation; and she began to dress for it\nwith much of the happy flutter which belongs to a ball. All went well:\nshe did not dislike her own looks; and when she came to the necklaces\nagain, her good fortune seemed complete, for upon trial the one given\nher by Miss Crawford would by no means go through the ring of the\ncross. She had, to oblige Edmund, resolved to wear it; but it was too\nlarge for the purpose. His, therefore, must be worn; and having, with\ndelightful feelings, joined the chain and the cross—those memorials of\nthe two most beloved of her heart, those dearest tokens so formed for\neach other by everything real and imaginary—and put them round her\nneck, and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were, she\nwas able, without an effort, to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford’s\nnecklace too. She acknowledged it to be right. Miss Crawford had a\nclaim; and when it was no longer to encroach on, to interfere with the\nstronger claims, the truer kindness of another, she could do her\njustice even with pleasure to herself. The necklace really looked very\nwell; and Fanny left her room at last, comfortably satisfied with\nherself and all about her."

She was introduced\nhere and there by her uncle, and forced to be spoken to, and to\ncurtsey, and speak again. This was a hard duty, and she was never\nsummoned to it without looking at William, as he walked about at his\nease in the background of the scene, and longing to be with him."

    "text": "The entrance of the Grants and Crawfords was a favourable epoch. The\nstiffness of the meeting soon gave way before their popular manners and\nmore diffused intimacies: little groups were formed, and everybody grew\ncomfortable. Fanny felt the advantage; and, drawing back from the toils\nof civility, would have been again most happy, could she have kept her\neyes from wandering between Edmund and Mary Crawford. _She_ looked all\nloveliness—and what might not be the end of it? Her own musings were\nbrought to an end on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her, and her\nthoughts were put into another channel by his engaging her almost\ninstantly for the first two dances. Her happiness on this occasion was\nvery much _à la mortal_, finely chequered. To be secure of a partner at\nfirst was a most essential good—for the moment of beginning was now\ngrowing seriously near; and she so little understood her own claims as\nto think that if Mr. Crawford had not asked her, she must have been the\nlast to be sought after, and should have received a partner only\nthrough a series of inquiry, and bustle, and interference, which would\nhave been terrible; but at the same time there was a pointedness in his\nmanner of asking her which she did not like, and she saw his eye\nglancing for a moment at her necklace, with a smile—she thought there\nwas a smile—which made her blush and feel wretched. And though there\nwas no second glance to disturb her, though his object seemed then to\nbe only quietly agreeable, she could not get the better of her\nembarrassment, heightened as it was by the idea of his perceiving it,\nand had no composure till he turned away to some one else. Then she\ncould gradually rise up to the genuine satisfaction of having a\npartner, a voluntary partner, secured against the dancing began."

Miss Crawford listened; and all her intended\ncompliments and insinuations to Fanny were forgotten: she felt only one\nthing; and her eyes, bright as they had been before, shewing they could\nyet be brighter, she exclaimed with eager pleasure, “Did he? Did\nEdmund? That was like himself. No other man would have thought of it. I\nhonour him beyond expression.” And she looked around as if longing to\ntell him so.

To be urging her opinion against Sir\nThomas’s was a proof of the extremity of the case; but such was her\nhorror at the first suggestion, that she could actually look him in the\nface and say that she hoped it might be settled otherwise; in vain,\nhowever: Sir Thomas smiled, tried to encourage her, and then looked too\nserious, and said too decidedly, “It must be so, my dear,” for her to\nhazard another word; and she found herself the next moment conducted by\nMr. Crawford to the top of the room, and standing there to be joined by\nthe rest of the dancers, couple after couple, as they were formed."

She was attractive, she was modest, she was Sir\nThomas’s niece, and she was soon said to be admired by Mr. Crawford. It\nwas enough to give her general favour. Sir Thomas himself was watching\nher progress down the dance with much complacency; he was proud of his\nniece; and without attributing all her personal beauty, as Mrs. Norris\nseemed to do, to her transplantation to Mansfield, he was pleased with\nhimself for having supplied everything else: education and manners she\nowed to him."

Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment in\nthe course of the evening; but Henry’s attentions had very little to do\nwith it. She would much rather _not_ have been asked by him again so\nvery soon, and she wished she had not been obliged to suspect that his\nprevious inquiries of Mrs. Norris, about the supper hour, were all for\nthe sake of securing her at that part of the evening. But it was not to\nbe avoided: he made her feel that she was the object of all; though she\ncould not say that it was unpleasantly done, that there was indelicacy\nor ostentation in his manner; and sometimes, when he talked of William,\nhe was really not unagreeable, and shewed even a warmth of heart which\ndid him credit. But still his attentions made no part of her\nsatisfaction. She was happy whenever she looked at William, and saw how\nperfectly he was enjoying himself, in every five minutes that she could\nwalk about with him and hear his account of his partners; she was happy\nin knowing herself admired; and she was happy in having the two dances\nwith Edmund still to look forward to, during the greatest part of the\nevening, her hand being so eagerly sought after that her indefinite\nengagement with _him_ was in continual perspective. She was happy even\nwhen they did take place; but not from any flow of spirits on his side,\nor any such expressions of tender gallantry as had blessed the morning.\nHis mind was fagged, and her happiness sprung from being the friend\nwith whom it could find repose. “I am worn out with civility,” said he.\n“I have been talking incessantly all night, and with nothing to say.\nBut with _you_, Fanny, there may be peace. You will not want to be\ntalked to. Let us have the luxury of silence.” Fanny would hardly even\nspeak her agreement. A weariness, arising probably, in great measure,\nfrom the same feelings which he had acknowledged in the morning, was\npeculiarly to be respected, and they went down their two dances\ntogether with such sober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker-on\nthat Sir Thomas had been bringing up no wife for his younger son."

    "text": "It was a heavy, melancholy day. Soon after the second breakfast, Edmund\nbade them good-bye for a week, and mounted his horse for Peterborough,\nand then all were gone. Nothing remained of last night but\nremembrances, which she had nobody to share in. She talked to her aunt\nBertram—she must talk to somebody of the ball; but her aunt had seen so\nlittle of what had passed, and had so little curiosity, that it was\nheavy work. Lady Bertram was not certain of anybody’s dress or\nanybody’s place at supper but her own. “She could not recollect what it\nwas that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes, or what it was\nthat Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny: she was not sure whether\nColonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he\nsaid he was the finest young man in the room—somebody had whispered\nsomething to her; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be.”\nAnd these were her longest speeches and clearest communications: the\nrest was only a languid “Yes, yes; very well; did you? did he? I did\nnot see _that_; I should not know one from the other.” This was very\nbad. It was only better than Mrs. Norris’s sharp answers would have\nbeen; but she being gone home with all the supernumerary jellies to\nnurse a sick maid, there was peace and good-humour in their little\nparty, though it could not boast much beside."

You\nare to deal, ma’am; shall I deal for you?” Fanny thought and thought\nagain of the difference which twenty-four hours had made in that room,\nand all that part of the house. Last night it had been hope and smiles,\nbustle and motion, noise and brilliancy, in the drawing-room, and out\nof the drawing-room, and everywhere. Now it was languor, and all but\nsolitude."

A great deal of good\nsense followed on Sir Thomas’s side, tending to reconcile his wife to\nthe arrangement. Everything that a considerate parent _ought_ to feel\nwas advanced for her use; and everything that an affectionate mother\n_must_ feel in promoting her children’s enjoyment was attributed to her\nnature. Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm “Yes”; and at the end\nof a quarter of an hour’s silent consideration spontaneously observed,\n“Sir Thomas, I have been thinking—and I am very glad we took Fanny as\nwe did, for now the others are away we feel the good of it.”"

    "text": "The week which passed so quietly and peaceably at the great house in\nMansfield had a very different character at the Parsonage. To the young\nlady, at least, in each family, it brought very different feelings.\nWhat was tranquillity and comfort to Fanny was tediousness and vexation\nto Mary. Something arose from difference of disposition and habit: one\nso easily satisfied, the other so unused to endure; but still more\nmight be imputed to difference of circumstances. In some points of\ninterest they were exactly opposed to each other. To Fanny’s mind,\nEdmund’s absence was really, in its cause and its tendency, a relief.\nTo Mary it was every way painful. She felt the want of his society\nevery day, almost every hour, and was too much in want of it to derive\nanything but irritation from considering the object for which he went.\nHe could not have devised anything more likely to raise his consequence\nthan this week’s absence, occurring as it did at the very time of her\nbrother’s going away, of William Price’s going too, and completing the\nsort of general break-up of a party which had been so animated. She\nfelt it keenly. They were now a miserable trio, confined within doors\nby a series of rain and snow, with nothing to do and no variety to hope\nfor. Angry as she was with Edmund for adhering to his own notions, and\nacting on them in defiance of her (and she had been so angry that they\nhad hardly parted friends at the ball), she could not help thinking of\nhim continually when absent, dwelling on his merit and affection, and\nlonging again for the almost daily meetings they lately had. His\nabsence was unnecessarily long. He should not have planned such an\nabsence—he should not have left home for a week, when her own departure\nfrom Mansfield was so near. Then she began to blame herself. She wished\nshe had not spoken so warmly in their last conversation. She was afraid\nshe had used some strong, some contemptuous expressions in speaking of\nthe clergy, and that should not have been. It was ill-bred; it was\nwrong. She wished such words unsaid with all her heart."

She had, moreover, to contend with one\ndisagreeable emotion entirely new to her—jealousy. His friend Mr. Owen\nhad sisters; he might find them attractive. But, at any rate, his\nstaying away at a time when, according to all preceding plans, she was\nto remove to London, meant something that she could not bear. Had Henry\nreturned, as he talked of doing, at the end of three or four days, she\nshould now have been leaving Mansfield. It became absolutely necessary\nfor her to get to Fanny and try to learn something more. She could not\nlive any longer in such solitary wretchedness; and she made her way to\nthe Park, through difficulties of walking which she had deemed\nunconquerable a week before, for the chance of hearing a little in\naddition, for the sake of at least hearing his name."

    "text": "Miss Crawford’s uneasiness was much lightened by this conversation, and\nshe walked home again in spirits which might have defied almost another\nweek of the same small party in the same bad weather, had they been put\nto the proof; but as that very evening brought her brother down from\nLondon again in quite, or more than quite, his usual cheerfulness, she\nhad nothing farther to try her own. His still refusing to tell her what\nhe had gone for was but the promotion of gaiety; a day before it might\nhave irritated, but now it was a pleasant joke—suspected only of\nconcealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself. And the\nnext day _did_ bring a surprise to her. Henry had said he should just\ngo and ask the Bertrams how they did, and be back in ten minutes, but\nhe was gone above an hour; and when his sister, who had been waiting\nfor him to walk with her in the garden, met him at last most\nimpatiently in the sweep, and cried out, “My dear Henry, where can you\nhave been all this time?” he had only to say that he had been sitting\nwith Lady Bertram and Fanny."

The gentleness, modesty,\nand sweetness of her character were warmly expatiated on; that\nsweetness which makes so essential a part of every woman’s worth in the\njudgment of man, that though he sometimes loves where it is not, he can\nnever believe it absent. Her temper he had good reason to depend on and\nto praise. He had often seen it tried. Was there one of the family,\nexcepting Edmund, who had not in some way or other continually\nexercised her patience and forbearance? Her affections were evidently\nstrong. To see her with her brother! What could more delightfully prove\nthat the warmth of her heart was equal to its gentleness? What could be\nmore encouraging to a man who had her love in view? Then, her\nunderstanding was beyond every suspicion, quick and clear; and her\nmanners were the mirror of her own modest and elegant mind. Nor was\nthis all. Henry Crawford had too much sense not to feel the worth of\ngood principles in a wife, though he was too little accustomed to\nserious reflection to know them by their proper name; but when he\ntalked of her having such a steadiness and regularity of conduct, such\na high notion of honour, and such an observance of decorum as might\nwarrant any man in the fullest dependence on her faith and integrity,\nhe expressed what was inspired by the knowledge of her being well\nprincipled and religious."

Sloop Thrush being made\nout was spreading general joy through a wide circle of great people."

I\nhave almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to\nhave known before all the world. I have not lost a moment, however. The\npost was late this morning, but there has not been since a moment’s\ndelay. How impatient, how anxious, how wild I have been on the subject,\nI will not attempt to describe; how severely mortified, how cruelly\ndisappointed, in not having it finished while I was in London! I was\nkept there from day to day in the hope of it, for nothing less dear to\nme than such an object would have detained me half the time from\nMansfield. But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the\nwarmth I could desire, and exerted himself immediately, there were\ndifficulties from the absence of one friend, and the engagements of\nanother, which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of, and\nknowing in what good hands I left the cause, I came away on Monday,\ntrusting that many posts would not pass before I should be followed by\nsuch very letters as these. My uncle, who is the very best man in the\nworld, has exerted himself, as I knew he would, after seeing your\nbrother. He was delighted with him. I would not allow myself yesterday\nto say how delighted, or to repeat half that the Admiral said in his\npraise. I deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise\nof a friend, as this day _does_ prove it. _Now_ I may say that even I\ncould not require William Price to excite a greater interest, or be\nfollowed by warmer wishes and higher commendation, than were most\nvoluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed\ntogether.”"

    "text": "Henry was most happy to make it more intelligible, by beginning at an\nearlier stage, and explaining very particularly what he had done. His\nlast journey to London had been undertaken with no other view than that\nof introducing her brother in Hill Street, and prevailing on the\nAdmiral to exert whatever interest he might have for getting him on.\nThis had been his business. He had communicated it to no creature: he\nhad not breathed a syllable of it even to Mary; while uncertain of the\nissue, he could not have borne any participation of his feelings, but\nthis had been his business; and he spoke with such a glow of what his\nsolicitude had been, and used such strong expressions, was so abounding\nin the _deepest_ _interest_, in _twofold_ _motives_, in _views_ _and_\n_wishes_ _more_ _than_ _could_ _be_ _told_, that Fanny could not have\nremained insensible of his drift, had she been able to attend; but her\nheart was so full and her senses still so astonished, that she could\nlisten but imperfectly even to what he told her of William, and saying\nonly when he paused, “How kind! how very kind! Oh, Mr. Crawford, we are\ninfinitely obliged to you! Dearest, dearest William!” She jumped up and\nmoved in haste towards the door, crying out, “I will go to my uncle. My\nuncle ought to know it as soon as possible.” But this could not be\nsuffered. The opportunity was too fair, and his feelings too impatient.\nHe was after her immediately. “She must not go, she must allow him five\nminutes longer,” and he took her hand and led her back to her seat, and\nwas in the middle of his farther explanation, before she had suspected\nfor what she was detained. When she did understand it, however, and\nfound herself expected to believe that she had created sensations which\nhis heart had never known before, and that everything he had done for\nWilliam was to be placed to the account of his excessive and unequalled\nattachment to her, she was exceedingly distressed, and for some moments\nunable to speak. She considered it all as nonsense, as mere trifling\nand gallantry, which meant only to deceive for the hour; she could not\nbut feel that it was treating her improperly and unworthily, and in\nsuch a way as she had not deserved; but it was like himself, and\nentirely of a piece with what she had seen before; and she would not\nallow herself to shew half the displeasure she felt, because he had\nbeen conferring an obligation, which no want of delicacy on his part\ncould make a trifle to her. While her heart was still bounding with joy\nand gratitude on William’s behalf, she could not be severely resentful\nof anything that injured only herself; and after having twice drawn\nback her hand, and twice attempted in vain to turn away from him, she\ngot up, and said only, with much agitation, “Don’t, Mr. Crawford, pray\ndon’t! I beg you would not. This is a sort of talking which is very\nunpleasant to me. I must go away. I cannot bear it.” But he was still\ntalking on, describing his affection, soliciting a return, and,\nfinally, in words so plain as to bear but one meaning even to her,\noffering himself, hand, fortune, everything, to her acceptance. It was\nso; he had said it. Her astonishment and confusion increased; and\nthough still not knowing how to suppose him serious, she could hardly\nstand. He pressed for an answer."

I am\naware that there has been sometimes, in some points, a misplaced\ndistinction; but I think too well of you, Fanny, to suppose you will\never harbour resentment on that account. You have an understanding\nwhich will prevent you from receiving things only in part, and judging\npartially by the event. You will take in the whole of the past, you\nwill consider times, persons, and probabilities, and you will feel that\n_they_ were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you\nfor that mediocrity of condition which _seemed_ to be your lot. Though\ntheir caution may prove eventually unnecessary, it was kindly meant;\nand of this you may be assured, that every advantage of affluence will\nbe doubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have been\nimposed. I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you, by\nfailing at any time to treat your aunt Norris with the respect and\nattention that are due to her. But enough of this. Sit down, my dear.

    "text": "Sir Thomas came towards the table where she sat in trembling\nwretchedness, and with a good deal of cold sternness, said, “It is of\nno use, I perceive, to talk to you. We had better put an end to this\nmost mortifying conference. Mr. Crawford must not be kept longer\nwaiting. I will, therefore, only add, as thinking it my duty to mark my\nopinion of your conduct, that you have disappointed every expectation I\nhad formed, and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what\nI had supposed. For I _had_, Fanny, as I think my behaviour must have\nshewn, formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my\nreturn to England. I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of\ntemper, self-conceit, and every tendency to that independence of spirit\nwhich prevails so much in modern days, even in young women, and which\nin young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence.\nBut you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse; that you\ncan and will decide for yourself, without any consideration or\ndeference for those who have surely some right to guide you, without\neven asking their advice. You have shewn yourself very, very different\nfrom anything that I had imagined. The advantage or disadvantage of\nyour family, of your parents, your brothers and sisters, never seems to\nhave had a moment’s share in your thoughts on this occasion. How _they_\nmight be benefited, how _they_ must rejoice in such an establishment\nfor you, is nothing to _you_. You think only of yourself, and because\nyou do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy\nimagines to be necessary for happiness, you resolve to refuse him at\nonce, without wishing even for a little time to consider of it, a\nlittle more time for cool consideration, and for really examining your\nown inclinations; and are, in a wild fit of folly, throwing away from\nyou such an opportunity of being settled in life, eligibly, honourably,\nnobly settled, as will, probably, never occur to you again. Here is a\nyoung man of sense, of character, of temper, of manners, and of\nfortune, exceedingly attached to you, and seeking your hand in the most\nhandsome and disinterested way; and let me tell you, Fanny, that you\nmay live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by\na man of half Mr. Crawford’s estate, or a tenth part of his merits.\nGladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him. Maria\nis nobly married; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia’s hand, I should\nhave given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than\nI gave Maria’s to Mr. Rushworth.” After half a moment’s pause: “And I\nshould have been very much surprised had either of my daughters, on\nreceiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it\nonly _half_ the eligibility of _this_, immediately and peremptorily,\nand without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any\nconsultation, put a decided negative on it. I should have been much\nsurprised and much hurt by such a proceeding. I should have thought it\na gross violation of duty and respect. _You_ are not to be judged by\nthe same rule. You do not owe me the duty of a child. But, Fanny, if\nyour heart can acquit you of _ingratitude_—”"

He knew\nher to be very timid, and exceedingly nervous; and thought it not\nimprobable that her mind might be in such a state as a little time, a\nlittle pressing, a little patience, and a little impatience, a\njudicious mixture of all on the lover’s side, might work their usual\neffect on. If the gentleman would but persevere, if he had but love\nenough to persevere, Sir Thomas began to have hopes; and these\nreflections having passed across his mind and cheered it, “Well,” said\nhe, in a tone of becoming gravity, but of less anger, “well, child, dry\nup your tears. There is no use in these tears; they can do no good. You\nmust now come downstairs with me. Mr. Crawford has been kept waiting\ntoo long already.

A\nlittle difficulty to be overcome was no evil to Henry Crawford. He\nrather derived spirits from it. He had been apt to gain hearts too\neasily. His situation was new and animating."

She found that he\ndid mean to persevere; but how he could, after such language from her\nas she felt herself obliged to use, was not to be understood. She told\nhim that she did not love him, could not love him, was sure she never\nshould love him; that such a change was quite impossible; that the\nsubject was most painful to her; that she must entreat him never to\nmention it again, to allow her to leave him at once, and let it be\nconsidered as concluded for ever. And when farther pressed, had added,\nthat in her opinion their dispositions were so totally dissimilar as to\nmake mutual affection incompatible; and that they were unfitted for\neach other by nature, education, and habit. All this she had said, and\nwith the earnestness of sincerity; yet this was not enough, for he\nimmediately denied there being anything uncongenial in their\ncharacters, or anything unfriendly in their situations; and positively\ndeclared, that he would still love, and still hope!"

Her diffidence, gratitude, and\nsoftness made every expression of indifference seem almost an effort of\nself-denial; seem, at least, to be giving nearly as much pain to\nherself as to him. Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who, as\nthe clandestine, insidious, treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram, had\nbeen her abhorrence, whom she had hated to see or to speak to, in whom\nshe could believe no good quality to exist, and whose power, even of\nbeing agreeable, she had barely acknowledged. He was now the Mr.\nCrawford who was addressing herself with ardent, disinterested love;\nwhose feelings were apparently become all that was honourable and\nupright, whose views of happiness were all fixed on a marriage of\nattachment; who was pouring out his sense of her merits, describing and\ndescribing again his affection, proving as far as words could prove it,\nand in the language, tone, and spirit of a man of talent too, that he\nsought her for her gentleness and her goodness; and to complete the\nwhole, he was now the Mr. Crawford who had procured William’s\npromotion!"

He staid of course, and Edmund had\nthen ample opportunity for observing how he sped with Fanny, and what\ndegree of immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from her\nmanners; and it was so little, so very, very little—every chance, every\npossibility of it, resting upon her embarrassment only; if there was\nnot hope in her confusion, there was hope in nothing else—that he was\nalmost ready to wonder at his friend’s perseverance. Fanny was worth it\nall; he held her to be worth every effort of patience, every exertion\nof mind, but he did not think he could have gone on himself with any\nwoman breathing, without something more to warm his courage than his\neyes could discern in hers. He was very willing to hope that Crawford\nsaw clearer, and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his\nfriend that he could come to from all that he observed to pass before,\nand at, and after dinner."

Not a look or an offer of help had\nFanny given; not a syllable for or against. All her attention was for\nher work. She seemed determined to be interested by nothing else. But\ntaste was too strong in her. She could not abstract her mind five\nminutes: she was forced to listen; his reading was capital, and her\npleasure in good reading extreme. To _good_ reading, however, she had\nbeen long used: her uncle read well, her cousins all, Edmund very well,\nbut in Mr. Crawford’s reading there was a variety of excellence beyond\nwhat she had ever met with. The King, the Queen, Buckingham, Wolsey,\nCromwell, all were given in turn; for with the happiest knack, the\nhappiest power of jumping and guessing, he could always alight at will\non the best scene, or the best speeches of each; and whether it were\ndignity, or pride, or tenderness, or remorse, or whatever were to be\nexpressed, he could do it with equal beauty. It was truly dramatic. His\nacting had first taught Fanny what pleasure a play might give, and his\nreading brought all his acting before her again; nay, perhaps with\ngreater enjoyment, for it came unexpectedly, and with no such drawback\nas she had been used to suffer in seeing him on the stage with Miss\nBertram."

It is he who sees and worships your merit the\nstrongest, who loves you most devotedly, that has the best right to a\nreturn. There I build my confidence. By that right I do and will\ndeserve you; and when once convinced that my attachment is what I\ndeclare it, I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes.\nYes, dearest, sweetest Fanny. Nay” (seeing her draw back displeased),\n“forgive me. Perhaps I have as yet no right; but by what other name can\nI call you? Do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under\nany other? No, it is ‘Fanny’ that I think of all day, and dream of all\nnight. You have given the name such reality of sweetness, that nothing\nelse can now be descriptive of you.”"

I was afraid of the bias of those\nworldly maxims, which she has been too much used to hear. But it was\nvery different. She spoke of you, Fanny, just as she ought. She desires\nthe connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself. We had a long talk\nabout it. I should not have mentioned the subject, though very anxious\nto know her sentiments; but I had not been in the room five minutes\nbefore she began introducing it with all that openness of heart, and\nsweet peculiarity of manner, that spirit and ingenuousness which are so\nmuch a part of herself. Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity.”"

Let him have all the\nperfections in the world, I think it ought not to be set down as\ncertain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to\nlike himself. But, even supposing it is so, allowing Mr. Crawford to\nhave all the claims which his sisters think he has, how was I to be\nprepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own? He took me\nwholly by surprise. I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before\nhad any meaning; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him\nonly because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me. In my\nsituation, it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming\nexpectations on Mr. Crawford. I am sure his sisters, rating him as they\ndo, must have thought it so, supposing he had meant nothing. How, then,\nwas I to be—to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me?\nHow was I to have an attachment at his service, as soon as it was asked\nfor? His sisters should consider me as well as him. The higher his\ndeserts, the more improper for me ever to have thought of him. And,\nand—we think very differently of the nature of women, if they can\nimagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this\nseems to imply.”"

It was curious,\nvery curious, that we should have such a scene to play! If I had the\npower of recalling any one week of my existence, it should be that\nweek—that acting week. Say what you would, Fanny, it should be _that_;\nfor I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other. His sturdy\nspirit to bend as it did! Oh! it was sweet beyond expression.

He\nis just what the head of such a family should be. Nay, in sober\nsadness, I believe I now love you all.” And having said so, with a\ndegree of tenderness and consciousness which Fanny had never seen in\nher before, and now thought only too becoming, she turned away for a\nmoment to recover herself. “I have had a little fit since I came into\nthis room, as you may perceive,” said she presently, with a playful\nsmile, “but it is over now; so let us sit down and be comfortable; for\nas to scolding you, Fanny, which I came fully intending to do, I have\nnot the heart for it when it comes to the point.” And embracing her\nvery affectionately, “Good, gentle Fanny! when I think of this being\nthe last time of seeing you for I do not know how long, I feel it quite\nimpossible to do anything but love you.”"

    "text": "“Why, Fanny, you are absolutely in a reverie. Thinking, I hope, of one\nwho is always thinking of you. Oh! that I could transport you for a\nshort time into our circle in town, that you might understand how your\npower over Henry is thought of there! Oh! the envyings and\nheartburnings of dozens and dozens; the wonder, the incredulity that\nwill be felt at hearing what you have done! For as to secrecy, Henry is\nquite the hero of an old romance, and glories in his chains. You should\ncome to London to know how to estimate your conquest. If you were to\nsee how he is courted, and how I am courted for his sake! Now, I am\nwell aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in\nconsequence of his situation with you. When she comes to know the truth\nshe will, very likely, wish me in Northamptonshire again; for there is\na daughter of Mr. Fraser, by a first wife, whom she is wild to get\nmarried, and wants Henry to take. Oh! she has been trying for him to\nsuch a degree. Innocent and quiet as you sit here, you cannot have an\nidea of the _sensation_ that you will be occasioning, of the curiosity\nthere will be to see you, of the endless questions I shall have to\nanswer! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and\nyour teeth, and how you do your hair, and who makes your shoes. I wish\nMargaret were married, for my poor friend’s sake, for I look upon the\nFrasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people. And yet it\nwas a most desirable match for Janet at the time. We were all\ndelighted. She could not do otherwise than accept him, for he was rich,\nand she had nothing; but he turns out ill-tempered and _exigeant_, and\nwants a young woman, a beautiful young woman of five-and-twenty, to be\nas steady as himself. And my friend does not manage him well; she does\nnot seem to know how to make the best of it. There is a spirit of\nirritation which, to say nothing worse, is certainly very ill-bred. In\ntheir house I shall call to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield\nParsonage with respect. Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence\nin my sister, and a certain consideration for her judgment, which makes\none feel there _is_ attachment; but of that I shall see nothing with\nthe Frasers. I shall be at Mansfield for ever, Fanny. My own sister as\na wife, Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband, are my standards of\nperfection. Poor Janet has been sadly taken in, and yet there was\nnothing improper on her side: she did not run into the match\ninconsiderately; there was no want of foresight. She took three days to\nconsider of his proposals, and during those three days asked the advice\nof everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having, and\nespecially applied to my late dear aunt, whose knowledge of the world\nmade her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the\nyoung people of her acquaintance, and she was decidedly in favour of\nMr. Fraser. This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial\ncomfort. I have not so much to say for my friend Flora, who jilted a\nvery nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord\nStornaway, who has about as much sense, Fanny, as Mr. Rushworth, but\nmuch worse-looking, and with a blackguard character. I _had_ my doubts\nat the time about her being right, for he has not even the air of a\ngentleman, and now I am sure she was wrong. By the bye, Flora Ross was\ndying for Henry the first winter she came out. But were I to attempt to\ntell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him, I\nshould never have done. It is you, only you, insensible Fanny, who can\nthink of him with anything like indifference. But are you so insensible\nas you profess yourself? No, no, I see you are not.”"

His\nobjections, the scruples of his integrity, seemed all done away, nobody\ncould tell how; and the doubts and hesitations of her ambition were\nequally got over—and equally without apparent reason.

He certainly wished her to go willingly, but he as certainly\nwished her to be heartily sick of home before her visit ended; and that\na little abstinence from the elegancies and luxuries of Mansfield Park\nwould bring her mind into a sober state, and incline her to a juster\nestimate of the value of that home of greater permanence, and equal\ncomfort, of which she had the offer."

    "text": "Had Fanny been at all addicted to raptures, she must have had a strong\nattack of them when she first understood what was intended, when her\nuncle first made her the offer of visiting the parents, and brothers,\nand sisters, from whom she had been divided almost half her life; of\nreturning for a couple of months to the scenes of her infancy, with\nWilliam for the protector and companion of her journey, and the\ncertainty of continuing to see William to the last hour of his\nremaining on land. Had she ever given way to bursts of delight, it must\nhave been then, for she was delighted, but her happiness was of a\nquiet, deep, heart-swelling sort; and though never a great talker, she\nwas always more inclined to silence when feeling most strongly. At the\nmoment she could only thank and accept. Afterwards, when familiarised\nwith the visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened, she could speak more\nlargely to William and Edmund of what she felt; but still there were\nemotions of tenderness that could not be clothed in words. The\nremembrance of all her earliest pleasures, and of what she had suffered\nin being torn from them, came over her with renewed strength, and it\nseemed as if to be at home again would heal every pain that had since\ngrown out of the separation. To be in the centre of such a circle,\nloved by so many, and more loved by all than she had ever been before;\nto feel affection without fear or restraint; to feel herself the equal\nof those who surrounded her; to be at peace from all mention of the\nCrawfords, safe from every look which could be fancied a reproach on\ntheir account. This was a prospect to be dwelt on with a fondness that\ncould be but half acknowledged."

Poor little Betsey; how cross Susan is\nto you! But you should not have taken it out, my dear, when I sent you\nto the drawer.

Poor Mary little\nthought it would be such a bone of contention when she gave it me to\nkeep, only two hours before she died. Poor little soul! she could but\njust speak to be heard, and she said so prettily, ‘Let sister Susan\nhave my knife, mama, when I am dead and buried.’ Poor little dear! she\nwas so fond of it, Fanny, that she would have it lay by her in bed, all\nthrough her illness. It was the gift of her good godmother, old Mrs.\nAdmiral Maxwell, only six weeks before she was taken for death. Poor\nlittle sweet creature! Well, she was taken away from evil to come. My\nown Betsey” (fondling her), “_you_ have not the luck of such a good\ngodmother. Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of such little people\nas you.”"

Her\nheart and her time were already quite full; she had neither leisure nor\naffection to bestow on Fanny.

These\nshared her heart: her time was given chiefly to her house and her\nservants. Her days were spent in a kind of slow bustle; all was busy\nwithout getting on, always behindhand and lamenting it, without\naltering her ways; wishing to be an economist, without contrivance or\nregularity; dissatisfied with her servants, without skill to make them\nbetter, and whether helping, or reprimanding, or indulging them,\nwithout any power of engaging their respect."

Here was another strange revolution of mind! She was\nreally glad to receive the letter when it did come. In her present\nexile from good society, and distance from everything that had been\nwont to interest her, a letter from one belonging to the set where her\nheart lived, written with affection, and some degree of elegance, was\nthoroughly acceptable. The usual plea of increasing engagements was\nmade in excuse for not having written to her earlier; “And now that I\nhave begun,” she continued, “my letter will not be worth your reading,\nfor there will be no little offering of love at the end, no three or\nfour lines _passionnées_ from the most devoted H. C. in the world, for\nHenry is in Norfolk; business called him to Everingham ten days ago, or\nperhaps he only pretended the call, for the sake of being travelling at\nthe same time that you were. But there he is, and, by the bye, his\nabsence may sufficiently account for any remissness of his sister’s in\nwriting, for there has been no ‘Well, Mary, when do you write to Fanny?\nIs not it time for you to write to Fanny?’ to spur me on. At last,\nafter various attempts at meeting, I have seen your cousins, ‘dear\nJulia and dearest Mrs. Rushworth’; they found me at home yesterday, and\nwe were glad to see each other again. We _seemed_ _very_ glad to see\neach other, and I do really think we were a little. We had a vast deal\nto say. Shall I tell you how Mrs. Rushworth looked when your name was\nmentioned? I did not use to think her wanting in self-possession, but\nshe had not quite enough for the demands of yesterday. Upon the whole,\nJulia was in the best looks of the two, at least after you were spoken\nof. There was no recovering the complexion from the moment that I spoke\nof ‘Fanny,’ and spoke of her as a sister should. But Mrs. Rushworth’s\nday of good looks will come; we have cards for her first party on the\n28th. Then she will be in beauty, for she will open one of the best\nhouses in Wimpole Street. I was in it two years ago, when it was Lady\nLascelle’s, and prefer it to almost any I know in London, and certainly\nshe will then feel, to use a vulgar phrase, that she has got her\npennyworth for her penny. Henry could not have afforded her such a\nhouse. I hope she will recollect it, and be satisfied, as well as she\nmay, with moving the queen of a palace, though the king may appear best\nin the background; and as I have no desire to tease her, I shall never\n_force_ your name upon her again. She will grow sober by degrees. From\nall that I hear and guess, Baron Wildenheim’s attentions to Julia\ncontinue, but I do not know that he has any serious encouragement. She\nought to do better. A poor honourable is no catch, and I cannot imagine\nany liking in the case, for take away his rants, and the poor baron has\nnothing. What a difference a vowel makes! If his rents were but equal\nto his rants! Your cousin Edmund moves slowly; detained, perchance, by\nparish duties. There may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be\nconverted. I am unwilling to fancy myself neglected for a _young_ one.\nAdieu! my dear sweet Fanny, this is a long letter from London: write me\na pretty one in reply to gladden Henry’s eyes, when he comes back, and\nsend me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain\nfor his sake.”"

The deed thoroughly answered:\na source of domestic altercation was entirely done away, and it was the\nmeans of opening Susan’s heart to her, and giving her something more to\nlove and be interested in. Susan shewed that she had delicacy: pleased\nas she was to be mistress of property which she had been struggling for\nat least two years, she yet feared that her sister’s judgment had been\nagainst her, and that a reproof was designed her for having so\nstruggled as to make the purchase necessary for the tranquillity of the\nhouse."

Her greatest wonder on the subject soon became—not\nthat Susan should have been provoked into disrespect and impatience\nagainst her better knowledge—but that so much better knowledge, so many\ngood notions should have been hers at all; and that, brought up in the\nmidst of negligence and error, she should have formed such proper\nopinions of what ought to be; she, who had had no cousin Edmund to\ndirect her thoughts or fix her principles."

By\ndegrees the girls came to spend the chief of the morning upstairs, at\nfirst only in working and talking, but after a few days, the\nremembrance of the said books grew so potent and stimulative that Fanny\nfound it impossible not to try for books again. There were none in her\nfather’s house; but wealth is luxurious and daring, and some of hers\nfound its way to a circulating library. She became a subscriber; amazed\nat being anything _in propria persona_, amazed at her own doings in\nevery way, to be a renter, a chuser of books! And to be having any\none’s improvement in view in her choice! But so it was. Susan had read\nnothing, and Fanny longed to give her a share in her own first\npleasures, and inspire a taste for the biography and poetry which she\ndelighted in herself."

Now they came to an\nunderstanding. Mrs. Price, it appeared, scarcely ever stirred out of\ndoors, except of a Sunday; she owned she could seldom, with her large\nfamily, find time for a walk. “Would she not, then, persuade her\ndaughters to take advantage of such weather, and allow him the pleasure\nof attending them?” Mrs. Price was greatly obliged and very complying.\n“Her daughters were very much confined; Portsmouth was a sad place;\nthey did not often get out; and she knew they had some errands in the\ntown, which they would be very glad to do.” And the consequence was,\nthat Fanny, strange as it was—strange, awkward, and distressing—found\nherself and Susan, within ten minutes, walking towards the High Street\nwith Mr. Crawford."

Fanny was most conveniently in want of rest. Crawford\ncould not have wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down; but\nhe could have wished her sister away. A quick-looking girl of Susan’s\nage was the very worst third in the world: totally different from Lady\nBertram, all eyes and ears; and there was no introducing the main point\nbefore her. He must content himself with being only generally\nagreeable, and letting Susan have her share of entertainment, with the\nindulgence, now and then, of a look or hint for the better-informed and\nconscious Fanny. Norfolk was what he had mostly to talk of: there he\nhad been some time, and everything there was rising in importance from\nhis present schemes. Such a man could come from no place, no society,\nwithout importing something to amuse; his journeys and his acquaintance\nwere all of use, and Susan was entertained in a way quite new to her.\nFor Fanny, somewhat more was related than the accidental agreeableness\nof the parties he had been in. For her approbation, the particular\nreason of his going into Norfolk at all, at this unusual time of year,\nwas given. It had been real business, relative to the renewal of a\nlease in which the welfare of a large and—he believed—industrious\nfamily was at stake. He had suspected his agent of some underhand\ndealing; of meaning to bias him against the deserving; and he had\ndetermined to go himself, and thoroughly investigate the merits of the\ncase. He had gone, had done even more good than he had foreseen, had\nbeen useful to more than his first plan had comprehended, and was now\nable to congratulate himself upon it, and to feel that in performing a\nduty, he had secured agreeable recollections for his own mind. He had\nintroduced himself to some tenants whom he had never seen before; he\nhad begun making acquaintance with cottages whose very existence,\nthough on his own estate, had been hitherto unknown to him. This was\naimed, and well aimed, at Fanny. It was pleasing to hear him speak so\nproperly; here he had been acting as he ought to do. To be the friend\nof the poor and the oppressed! Nothing could be more grateful to her;\nand she was on the point of giving him an approving look, when it was\nall frightened off by his adding a something too pointed of his hoping\nsoon to have an assistant, a friend, a guide in every plan of utility\nor charity for Everingham: a somebody that would make Everingham and\nall about it a dearer object than it had ever been yet."

But Sunday made her a very creditable and\ntolerably cheerful-looking Mrs. Price, coming abroad with a fine family\nof children, feeling a little respite of her weekly cares, and only\ndiscomposed if she saw her boys run into danger, or Rebecca pass by\nwith a flower in her hat."

Nay, had she been without his\narm, she would soon have known that she needed it, for she wanted\nstrength for a two hours’ saunter of this kind, coming, as it generally\ndid, upon a week’s previous inactivity. Fanny was beginning to feel the\neffect of being debarred from her usual regular exercise; she had lost\nground as to health since her being in Portsmouth; and but for Mr.\nCrawford and the beauty of the weather would soon have been knocked up\nnow."

He makes me write, but I do not know what else is to be\ncommunicated, except this said visit to Portsmouth, and these two said\nwalks, and his introduction to your family, especially to a fair sister\nof yours, a fine girl of fifteen, who was of the party on the ramparts,\ntaking her first lesson, I presume, in love. I have not time for\nwriting much, but it would be out of place if I had, for this is to be\na mere letter of business, penned for the purpose of conveying\nnecessary information, which could not be delayed without risk of evil.\nMy dear, dear Fanny, if I had you here, how I would talk to you! You\nshould listen to me till you were tired, and advise me till you were\nstill tired more; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my\ngreat mind on paper, so I will abstain altogether, and leave you to\nguess what you like. I have no news for you. You have politics, of\ncourse; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people\nand parties that fill up my time. I ought to have sent you an account\nof your cousin’s first party, but I was lazy, and now it is too long\nago; suffice it, that everything was just as it ought to be, in a style\nthat any of her connexions must have been gratified to witness, and\nthat her own dress and manners did her the greatest credit. My friend,\nMrs. Fraser, is mad for such a house, and it would not make _me_\nmiserable. I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter; she seems in high\nspirits, and very happy. I fancy Lord S. is very good-humoured and\npleasant in his own family, and I do not think him so very ill-looking\nas I did—at least, one sees many worse. He will not do by the side of\nyour cousin Edmund. Of the last-mentioned hero, what shall I say? If I\navoided his name entirely, it would look suspicious. I will say, then,\nthat we have seen him two or three times, and that my friends here are\nvery much struck with his gentlemanlike appearance. Mrs. Fraser (no bad\njudge) declares she knows but three men in town who have so good a\nperson, height, and air; and I must confess, when he dined here the\nother day, there were none to compare with him, and we were a party of\nsixteen. Luckily there is no distinction of dress nowadays to tell\ntales, but—but—but Yours affectionately.”"

My poor aunt\nalways felt affected if within ten miles of the sea, which the Admiral\nof course never believed, but I know it was so. I am at your service\nand Henry’s, at an hour’s notice.

Edmund had not yet spoken.\nHow Miss Crawford really felt, how she meant to act, or might act\nwithout or against her meaning; whether his importance to her were\nquite what it had been before the last separation; whether, if\nlessened, it were likely to lessen more, or to recover itself, were\nsubjects for endless conjecture, and to be thought of on that day and\nmany days to come, without producing any conclusion. The idea that\nreturned the oftenest was that Miss Crawford, after proving herself\ncooled and staggered by a return to London habits, would yet prove\nherself in the end too much attached to him to give him up. She would\ntry to be more ambitious than her heart would allow. She would\nhesitate, she would tease, she would condition, she would require a\ngreat deal, but she would finally accept."

The prospect for her cousin grew worse and worse. The\nwoman who could speak of him, and speak only of his appearance! What an\nunworthy attachment! To be deriving support from the commendations of\nMrs. Fraser! _She_ who had known him intimately half a year! Fanny was\nashamed of her. Those parts of the letter which related only to Mr.\nCrawford and herself, touched her, in comparison, slightly. Whether Mr.\nCrawford went into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly no\nconcern of hers, though, everything considered, she thought he _would_\ngo without delay. That Miss Crawford should endeavour to secure a\nmeeting between him and Mrs. Rushworth, was all in her worst line of\nconduct, and grossly unkind and ill-judged; but she hoped _he_ would\nnot be actuated by any such degrading curiosity. He acknowledged no\nsuch inducement, and his sister ought to have given him credit for\nbetter feelings than her own."

    "text": "“My Dear Fanny,—Excuse me that I have not written before. Crawford told\nme that you were wishing to hear from me, but I found it impossible to\nwrite from London, and persuaded myself that you would understand my\nsilence. Could I have sent a few happy lines, they should not have been\nwanting, but nothing of that nature was ever in my power. I am returned\nto Mansfield in a less assured state than when I left it. My hopes are\nmuch weaker. You are probably aware of this already. So very fond of\nyou as Miss Crawford is, it is most natural that she should tell you\nenough of her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine. I will\nnot be prevented, however, from making my own communication. Our\nconfidences in you need not clash. I ask no questions. There is\nsomething soothing in the idea that we have the same friend, and that\nwhatever unhappy differences of opinion may exist between us, we are\nunited in our love of you. It will be a comfort to me to tell you how\nthings now are, and what are my present plans, if plans I can be said\nto have. I have been returned since Saturday. I was three weeks in\nLondon, and saw her (for London) very often. I had every attention from\nthe Frasers that could be reasonably expected. I dare say I was not\nreasonable in carrying with me hopes of an intercourse at all like that\nof Mansfield. It was her manner, however, rather than any unfrequency\nof meeting. Had she been different when I did see her, I should have\nmade no complaint, but from the very first she was altered: my first\nreception was so unlike what I had hoped, that I had almost resolved on\nleaving London again directly. I need not particularise. You know the\nweak side of her character, and may imagine the sentiments and\nexpressions which were torturing me. She was in high spirits, and\nsurrounded by those who were giving all the support of their own bad\nsense to her too lively mind. I do not like Mrs. Fraser. She is a\ncold-hearted, vain woman, who has married entirely from convenience,\nand though evidently unhappy in her marriage, places her disappointment\nnot to faults of judgment, or temper, or disproportion of age, but to\nher being, after all, less affluent than many of her acquaintance,\nespecially than her sister, Lady Stornaway, and is the determined\nsupporter of everything mercenary and ambitious, provided it be only\nmercenary and ambitious enough. I look upon her intimacy with those two\nsisters as the greatest misfortune of her life and mine. They have been\nleading her astray for years. Could she be detached from them!—and\nsometimes I do not despair of it, for the affection appears to me\nprincipally on their side. They are very fond of her; but I am sure she\ndoes not love them as she loves you. When I think of her great\nattachment to you, indeed, and the whole of her judicious, upright\nconduct as a sister, she appears a very different creature, capable of\neverything noble, and I am ready to blame myself for a too harsh\nconstruction of a playful manner. I cannot give her up, Fanny. She is\nthe only woman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife. If I\ndid not believe that she had some regard for me, of course I should not\nsay this, but I do believe it. I am convinced that she is not without a\ndecided preference. I have no jealousy of any individual. It is the\ninfluence of the fashionable world altogether that I am jealous of. It\nis the habits of wealth that I fear. Her ideas are not higher than her\nown fortune may warrant, but they are beyond what our incomes united\ncould authorise. There is comfort, however, even here. I could better\nbear to lose her because not rich enough, than because of my\nprofession. That would only prove her affection not equal to\nsacrifices, which, in fact, I am scarcely justified in asking; and, if\nI am refused, that, I think, will be the honest motive. Her prejudices,\nI trust, are not so strong as they were. You have my thoughts exactly\nas they arise, my dear Fanny; perhaps they are sometimes contradictory,\nbut it will not be a less faithful picture of my mind. Having once\nbegun, it is a pleasure to me to tell you all I feel. I cannot give her\nup. Connected as we already are, and, I hope, are to be, to give up\nMary Crawford would be to give up the society of some of those most\ndear to me; to banish myself from the very houses and friends whom,\nunder any other distress, I should turn to for consolation. The loss of\nMary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and of\nFanny. Were it a decided thing, an actual refusal, I hope I should know\nhow to bear it, and how to endeavour to weaken her hold on my heart,\nand in the course of a few years—but I am writing nonsense. Were I\nrefused, I must bear it; and till I am, I can never cease to try for\nher. This is the truth. The only question is _how_? What may be the\nlikeliest means? I have sometimes thought of going to London again\nafter Easter, and sometimes resolved on doing nothing till she returns\nto Mansfield. Even now, she speaks with pleasure of being in Mansfield\nin June; but June is at a great distance, and I believe I shall write\nto her. I have nearly determined on explaining myself by letter. To be\nat an early certainty is a material object. My present state is\nmiserably irksome. Considering everything, I think a letter will be\ndecidedly the best method of explanation. I shall be able to write much\nthat I could not say, and shall be giving her time for reflection\nbefore she resolves on her answer, and I am less afraid of the result\nof reflection than of an immediate hasty impulse; I think I am. My\ngreatest danger would lie in her consulting Mrs. Fraser, and I at a\ndistance unable to help my own cause. A letter exposes to all the evil\nof consultation, and where the mind is anything short of perfect\ndecision, an adviser may, in an unlucky moment, lead it to do what it\nmay afterwards regret. I must think this matter over a little. This\nlong letter, full of my own concerns alone, will be enough to tire even\nthe friendship of a Fanny. The last time I saw Crawford was at Mrs.\nFraser’s party. I am more and more satisfied with all that I see and\nhear of him. There is not a shadow of wavering. He thoroughly knows his\nown mind, and acts up to his resolutions: an inestimable quality. I\ncould not see him and my eldest sister in the same room without\nrecollecting what you once told me, and I acknowledge that they did not\nmeet as friends. There was marked coolness on her side. They scarcely\nspoke. I saw him draw back surprised, and I was sorry that Mrs.\nRushworth should resent any former supposed slight to Miss Bertram. You\nwill wish to hear my opinion of Maria’s degree of comfort as a wife.\nThere is no appearance of unhappiness. I hope they get on pretty well\ntogether. I dined twice in Wimpole Street, and might have been there\noftener, but it is mortifying to be with Rushworth as a brother. Julia\nseems to enjoy London exceedingly. I had little enjoyment there, but\nhave less here. We are not a lively party. You are very much wanted. I\nmiss you more than I can express. My mother desires her best love, and\nhopes to hear from you soon. She talks of you almost every hour, and I\nam sorry to find how many weeks more she is likely to be without you.\nMy father means to fetch you himself, but it will not be till after\nEaster, when he has business in town. You are happy at Portsmouth, I\nhope, but this must not be a yearly visit. I want you at home, that I\nmay have your opinion about Thornton Lacey. I have little heart for\nextensive improvements till I know that it will ever have a mistress. I\nthink I shall certainly write. It is quite settled that the Grants go\nto Bath; they leave Mansfield on Monday. I am glad of it. I am not\ncomfortable enough to be fit for anybody; but your aunt seems to feel\nout of luck that such an article of Mansfield news should fall to my\npen instead of hers.—Yours ever, my dearest Fanny.”"

As for the main subject\nof the letter, there was nothing in that to soothe irritation. She was\nalmost vexed into displeasure and anger against Edmund. “There is no\ngood in this delay,” said she. “Why is not it settled? He is blinded,\nand nothing will open his eyes; nothing can, after having had truths\nbefore him so long in vain. He will marry her, and be poor and\nmiserable. God grant that her influence do not make him cease to be\nrespectable!” She looked over the letter again. “‘So very fond of me!’\n’tis nonsense all. She loves nobody but herself and her brother. Her\nfriends leading her astray for years! She is quite as likely to have\nled _them_ astray. They have all, perhaps, been corrupting one another;\nbut if they are so much fonder of her than she is of them, she is the\nless likely to have been hurt, except by their flattery. ‘The only\nwoman in the world whom he could ever think of as a wife.’ I firmly\nbelieve it. It is an attachment to govern his whole life. Accepted or\nrefused, his heart is wedded to her for ever. ‘The loss of Mary I must\nconsider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and Fanny.’ Edmund, you\ndo not know me. The families would never be connected if you did not\nconnect them! Oh! write, write. Finish it at once. Let there be an end\nof this suspense. Fix, commit, condemn yourself.”"

She could just find selfishness enough to wonder\nwhether Edmund _had_ written to Miss Crawford before this summons came,\nbut no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate\nand disinterestedly anxious. Her aunt did not neglect her: she wrote\nagain and again; they were receiving frequent accounts from Edmund, and\nthese accounts were as regularly transmitted to Fanny, in the same\ndiffuse style, and the same medley of trusts, hopes, and fears, all\nfollowing and producing each other at haphazard. It was a sort of\nplaying at being frightened. The sufferings which Lady Bertram did not\nsee had little power over her fancy; and she wrote very comfortably\nabout agitation, and anxiety, and poor invalids, till Tom was actually\nconveyed to Mansfield, and her own eyes had beheld his altered\nappearance. Then a letter which she had been previously preparing for\nFanny was finished in a different style, in the language of real\nfeeling and alarm; then she wrote as she might have spoken. “He is just\ncome, my dear Fanny, and is taken upstairs; and I am so shocked to see\nhim, that I do not know what to do. I am sure he has been very ill.\nPoor Tom! I am quite grieved for him, and very much frightened, and so\nis Sir Thomas; and how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me.\nBut Sir Thomas hopes he will be better to-morrow, and says we must\nconsider his journey.”"

Three\nor four Prices might have been swept away, any or all except Fanny and\nWilliam, and Lady Bertram would have thought little about it; or\nperhaps might have caught from Mrs. Norris’s lips the cant of its being\na very happy thing and a great blessing to their poor dear sister Price\nto have them so well provided for."

    "text": "At about the week’s end from his return to Mansfield, Tom’s immediate\ndanger was over, and he was so far pronounced safe as to make his\nmother perfectly easy; for being now used to the sight of him in his\nsuffering, helpless state, and hearing only the best, and never\nthinking beyond what she heard, with no disposition for alarm and no\naptitude at a hint, Lady Bertram was the happiest subject in the world\nfor a little medical imposition. The fever was subdued; the fever had\nbeen his complaint; of course he would soon be well again. Lady Bertram\ncould think nothing less, and Fanny shared her aunt’s security, till\nshe received a few lines from Edmund, written purposely to give her a\nclearer idea of his brother’s situation, and acquaint her with the\napprehensions which he and his father had imbibed from the physician\nwith respect to some strong hectic symptoms, which seemed to seize the\nframe on the departure of the fever. They judged it best that Lady\nBertram should not be harassed by alarms which, it was to be hoped,\nwould prove unfounded; but there was no reason why Fanny should not\nknow the truth. They were apprehensive for his lungs."

There was hardly any one in the house who might not have\ndescribed, from personal observation, better than herself; not one who\nwas not more useful at times to her son. She could do nothing but glide\nin quietly and look at him; but when able to talk or be talked to, or\nread to, Edmund was the companion he preferred. His aunt worried him by\nher cares, and Sir Thomas knew not how to bring down his conversation\nor his voice to the level of irritation and feebleness. Edmund was all\nin all. Fanny would certainly believe him so at least, and must find\nthat her estimation of him was higher than ever when he appeared as the\nattendant, supporter, cheerer of a suffering brother. There was not\nonly the debility of recent illness to assist: there was also, as she\nnow learnt, nerves much affected, spirits much depressed to calm and\nraise, and her own imagination added that there must be a mind to be\nproperly guided."

Portsmouth was Portsmouth;\nMansfield was home. They had been long so arranged in the indulgence of\nher secret meditations, and nothing was more consolatory to her than to\nfind her aunt using the same language: “I cannot but say I much regret\nyour being from home at this distressing time, so very trying to my\nspirits. I trust and hope, and sincerely wish you may never be absent\nfrom home so long again,” were most delightful sentences to her. Still,\nhowever, it was her private regale. Delicacy to her parents made her\ncareful not to betray such a preference of her uncle’s house. It was\nalways: “When I go back into Northamptonshire, or when I return to\nMansfield, I shall do so and so.” For a great while it was so, but at\nlast the longing grew stronger, it overthrew caution, and she found\nherself talking of what she should do when she went home before she was\naware. She reproached herself, coloured, and looked fearfully towards\nher father and mother. She need not have been uneasy. There was no sign\nof displeasure, or even of hearing her. They were perfectly free from\nany jealousy of Mansfield. She was as welcome to wish herself there as\nto be there."

This is my modest\nrequest and expectation, for you are so good, that I depend upon being\ntreated better than I deserve, and I write now to beg an immediate\nanswer. I want to know the state of things at Mansfield Park, and you,\nno doubt, are perfectly able to give it. One should be a brute not to\nfeel for the distress they are in; and from what I hear, poor Mr.\nBertram has a bad chance of ultimate recovery. I thought little of his\nillness at first. I looked upon him as the sort of person to be made a\nfuss with, and to make a fuss himself in any trifling disorder, and was\nchiefly concerned for those who had to nurse him; but now it is\nconfidently asserted that he is really in a decline, that the symptoms\nare most alarming, and that part of the family, at least, are aware of\nit. If it be so, I am sure you must be included in that part, that\ndiscerning part, and therefore entreat you to let me know how far I\nhave been rightly informed. I need not say how rejoiced I shall be to\nhear there has been any mistake, but the report is so prevalent that I\nconfess I cannot help trembling. To have such a fine young man cut off\nin the flower of his days is most melancholy. Poor Sir Thomas will feel\nit dreadfully. I really am quite agitated on the subject. Fanny, Fanny,\nI see you smile and look cunning, but, upon my honour, I never bribed a\nphysician in my life. Poor young man! If he is to die, there will be\n_two_ poor young men less in the world; and with a fearless face and\nbold voice would I say to any one, that wealth and consequence could\nfall into no hands more deserving of them. It was a foolish\nprecipitation last Christmas, but the evil of a few days may be blotted\nout in part. Varnish and gilding hide many stains. It will be but the\nloss of the Esquire after his name. With real affection, Fanny, like\nmine, more might be overlooked. Write to me by return of post, judge of\nmy anxiety, and do not trifle with it. Tell me the real truth, as you\nhave it from the fountainhead. And now, do not trouble yourself to be\nashamed of either my feelings or your own. Believe me, they are not\nonly natural, they are philanthropic and virtuous. I put it to your\nconscience, whether ‘Sir Edmund’ would not do more good with all the\nBertram property than any other possible ‘Sir.’ Had the Grants been at\nhome I would not have troubled you, but you are now the only one I can\napply to for the truth, his sisters not being within my reach. Mrs. R.\nhas been spending the Easter with the Aylmers at Twickenham (as to be\nsure you know), and is not yet returned; and Julia is with the cousins\nwho live near Bedford Square, but I forget their name and street. Could\nI immediately apply to either, however, I should still prefer you,\nbecause it strikes me that they have all along been so unwilling to\nhave their own amusements cut up, as to shut their eyes to the truth. I\nsuppose Mrs. R.’s Easter holidays will not last much longer; no doubt\nthey are thorough holidays to her. The Aylmers are pleasant people; and\nher husband away, she can have nothing but enjoyment. I give her credit\nfor promoting his going dutifully down to Bath, to fetch his mother;\nbut how will she and the dowager agree in one house? Henry is not at\nhand, so I have nothing to say from him. Do not you think Edmund would\nhave been in town again long ago, but for this illness?—Yours ever,\nMary.”"

To herself,\nindividually, it was most tempting. To be finding herself, perhaps\nwithin three days, transported to Mansfield, was an image of the\ngreatest felicity, but it would have been a material drawback to be\nowing such felicity to persons in whose feelings and conduct, at the\npresent moment, she saw so much to condemn: the sister’s feelings, the\nbrother’s conduct, _her_ cold-hearted ambition, _his_ thoughtless\nvanity. To have him still the acquaintance, the flirt perhaps, of Mrs.\nRushworth! She was mortified. She had thought better of him. Happily,\nhowever, she was not left to weigh and decide between opposite\ninclinations and doubtful notions of right; there was no occasion to\ndetermine whether she ought to keep Edmund and Mary asunder or not. She\nhad a rule to apply to, which settled everything. Her awe of her uncle,\nand her dread of taking a liberty with him, made it instantly plain to\nher what she had to do. She must absolutely decline the proposal. If he\nwanted, he would send for her; and even to offer an early return was a\npresumption which hardly anything would have seemed to justify. She\nthanked Miss Crawford, but gave a decided negative. “Her uncle, she\nunderstood, meant to fetch her; and as her cousin’s illness had\ncontinued so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary, she\nmust suppose her return would be unwelcome at present, and that she\nshould be felt an encumbrance.”"

Here, its power was only a glare: a\nstifling, sickly glare, serving but to bring forward stains and dirt\nthat might otherwise have slept. There was neither health nor gaiety in\nsunshine in a town. She sat in a blaze of oppressive heat, in a cloud\nof moving dust, and her eyes could only wander from the walls, marked\nby her father’s head, to the table cut and notched by her brothers,\nwhere stood the tea-board never thoroughly cleaned, the cups and\nsaucers wiped in streaks, the milk a mixture of motes floating in thin\nblue, and the bread and butter growing every minute more greasy than\neven Rebecca’s hands had first produced it. Her father read his\nnewspaper, and her mother lamented over the ragged carpet as usual,\nwhile the tea was in preparation, and wished Rebecca would mend it; and\nFanny was first roused by his calling out to her, after humphing and\nconsidering over a particular paragraph: “What’s the name of your great\ncousins in town, Fan?”"

Fanny began to dread the meeting with\nher aunts and Tom, under so dreadful a humiliation; and Susan to feel\nwith some anxiety, that all her best manners, all her lately acquired\nknowledge of what was practised here, was on the point of being called\ninto action. Visions of good and ill breeding, of old vulgarisms and\nnew gentilities, were before her; and she was meditating much upon\nsilver forks, napkins, and finger-glasses. Fanny had been everywhere\nawake to the difference of the country since February; but when they\nentered the Park her perceptions and her pleasures were of the keenest\nsort. It was three months, full three months, since her quitting it,\nand the change was from winter to summer. Her eye fell everywhere on\nlawns and plantations of the freshest green; and the trees, though not\nfully clothed, were in that delightful state when farther beauty is\nknown to be at hand, and when, while much is actually given to the\nsight, more yet remains for the imagination. Her enjoyment, however,\nwas for herself alone. Edmund could not share it. She looked at him,\nbut he was leaning back, sunk in a deeper gloom than ever, and with\neyes closed, as if the view of cheerfulness oppressed him, and the\nlovely scenes of home must be shut out."

She had not spirits to notice her in more\nthan a few repulsive looks, but she felt her as a spy, and an intruder,\nand an indigent niece, and everything most odious. By her other aunt,\nSusan was received with quiet kindness. Lady Bertram could not give her\nmuch time, or many words, but she felt her, as Fanny’s sister, to have\na claim at Mansfield, and was ready to kiss and like her; and Susan was\nmore than satisfied, for she came perfectly aware that nothing but\nill-humour was to be expected from aunt Norris; and was so provided\nwith happiness, so strong in that best of blessings, an escape from\nmany certain evils, that she could have stood against a great deal more\nindifference than she met with from the others."

Very soon\nafter the Rushworths’ return to Wimpole Street, Sir Thomas had received\na letter from an old and most particular friend in London, who hearing\nand witnessing a good deal to alarm him in that quarter, wrote to\nrecommend Sir Thomas’s coming to London himself, and using his\ninfluence with his daughter to put an end to the intimacy which was\nalready exposing her to unpleasant remarks, and evidently making Mr.\nRushworth uneasy."

The\nopening was alarming. He had seen Miss Crawford. He had been invited to\nsee her. He had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call;\nand regarding it as what was meant to be the last, last interview of\nfriendship, and investing her with all the feelings of shame and\nwretchedness which Crawford’s sister ought to have known, he had gone\nto her in such a state of mind, so softened, so devoted, as made it for\na few moments impossible to Fanny’s fears that it should be the last.\nBut as he proceeded in his story, these fears were over. She had met\nhim, he said, with a serious—certainly a serious—even an agitated air;\nbut before he had been able to speak one intelligible sentence, she had\nintroduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him. “‘I\nheard you were in town,’ said she; ‘I wanted to see you. Let us talk\nover this sad business. What can equal the folly of our two relations?’\nI could not answer, but I believe my looks spoke. She felt reproved.\nSometimes how quick to feel! With a graver look and voice she then\nadded, ‘I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister’s expense.’ So she\nbegan, but how she went on, Fanny, is not fit, is hardly fit to be\nrepeated to you. I cannot recall all her words. I would not dwell upon\nthem if I could. Their substance was great anger at the _folly_ of\neach. She reprobated her brother’s folly in being drawn on by a woman\nwhom he had never cared for, to do what must lose him the woman he\nadored; but still more the folly of poor Maria, in sacrificing such a\nsituation, plunging into such difficulties, under the idea of being\nreally loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear.\nGuess what I must have felt. To hear the woman whom—no harsher name\nthan folly given! So voluntarily, so freely, so coolly to canvass it!\nNo reluctance, no horror, no feminine, shall I say, no modest\nloathings? This is what the world does. For where, Fanny, shall we find\na woman whom nature had so richly endowed? Spoilt, spoilt!”"

In some circles, we know, she would never be admitted,\nbut with good dinners, and large parties, there will always be those\nwho will be glad of her acquaintance; and there is, undoubtedly, more\nliberality and candour on those points than formerly.

That, perhaps, it was best\nfor me; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship, feelings,\nhopes which must, at any rate, have been torn from me now. And yet,\nthat I must and would confess that, could I have restored her to what\nshe had appeared to me before, I would infinitely prefer any increase\nof the pain of parting, for the sake of carrying with me the right of\ntenderness and esteem. This is what I said, the purport of it; but, as\nyou may imagine, not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have\nrepeated it to you. She was astonished, exceedingly astonished—more\nthan astonished. I saw her change countenance. She turned extremely\nred. I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings: a great, though short\nstruggle; half a wish of yielding to truths, half a sense of shame, but\nhabit, habit carried it. She would have laughed if she could. It was a\nsort of laugh, as she answered, ‘A pretty good lecture, upon my word.\nWas it part of your last sermon? At this rate you will soon reform\neverybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey; and when I hear of you next,\nit may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of Methodists,\nor as a missionary into foreign parts.’ She tried to speak carelessly,\nbut she was not so careless as she wanted to appear. I only said in\nreply, that from my heart I wished her well, and earnestly hoped that\nshe might soon learn to think more justly, and not owe the most\nvaluable knowledge we could any of us acquire, the knowledge of\nourselves and of our duty, to the lessons of affliction, and\nimmediately left the room. I had gone a few steps, Fanny, when I heard\nthe door open behind me. ‘Mr. Bertram,’ said she. I looked back. ‘Mr.\nBertram,’ said she, with a smile; but it was a smile ill-suited to the\nconversation that had passed, a saucy playful smile, seeming to invite\nin order to subdue me; at least it appeared so to me. I resisted; it\nwas the impulse of the moment to resist, and still walked on. I have\nsince, sometimes, for a moment, regretted that I did not go back, but I\nknow I was right, and such has been the end of our acquaintance. And\nwhat an acquaintance has it been! How have I been deceived! Equally in\nbrother and sister deceived! I thank you for your patience, Fanny. This\nhas been the greatest relief, and now we will have done.”"

Then, however, it all came on again, or\nsomething very like it, and nothing less than Lady Bertram’s rousing\nthoroughly up could really close such a conversation. Till that\nhappened, they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone, and how she\nhad attached him, and how delightful nature had made her, and how\nexcellent she would have been, had she fallen into good hands earlier.\nFanny, now at liberty to speak openly, felt more than justified in\nadding to his knowledge of her real character, by some hint of what\nshare his brother’s state of health might be supposed to have in her\nwish for a complete reconciliation. This was not an agreeable\nintimation. Nature resisted it for a while. It would have been a vast\ndeal pleasanter to have had her more disinterested in her attachment;\nbut his vanity was not of a strength to fight long against reason. He\nsubmitted to believe that Tom’s illness had influenced her, only\nreserving for himself this consoling thought, that considering the many\ncounteractions of opposing habits, she had certainly been _more_\nattached to him than could have been expected, and for his sake been\nmore near doing right. Fanny thought exactly the same; and they were\nalso quite agreed in their opinion of the lasting effect, the indelible\nimpression, which such a disappointment must make on his mind. Time\nwould undoubtedly abate somewhat of his sufferings, but still it was a\nsort of thing which he never could get entirely the better of; and as\nto his ever meeting with any other woman who could—it was too\nimpossible to be named but with indignation. Fanny’s friendship was all\nthat he had to cling to."

There was\ncomfort also in Tom, who gradually regained his health, without\nregaining the thoughtlessness and selfishness of his previous habits.\nHe was the better for ever for his illness. He had suffered, and he had\nlearned to think: two advantages that he had never known before; and\nthe self-reproach arising from the deplorable event in Wimpole Street,\nto which he felt himself accessory by all the dangerous intimacy of his\nunjustifiable theatre, made an impression on his mind which, at the age\nof six-and-twenty, with no want of sense or good companions, was\ndurable in its happy effects. He became what he ought to be: useful to\nhis father, steady and quiet, and not living merely for himself."

Dr.\nGrant, through an interest on which he had almost ceased to form hopes,\nsucceeded to a stall in Westminster, which, as affording an occasion\nfor leaving Mansfield, an excuse for residence in London, and an\nincrease of income to answer the expenses of the change, was highly\nacceptable to those who went and those who staid."

They lived together; and when Dr.\nGrant had brought on apoplexy and death, by three great institutionary\ndinners in one week, they still lived together; for Mary, though\nperfectly resolved against ever attaching herself to a younger brother\nagain, was long in finding among the dashing representatives, or idle\nheir-apparents, who were at the command of her beauty, and her £20,000,\nany one who could satisfy the better taste she had acquired at\nMansfield, whose character and manners could authorise a hope of the\ndomestic happiness she had there learned to estimate, or put Edmund\nBertram sufficiently out of her head."

Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford, and\nobserving to Fanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with\nsuch another woman, before it began to strike him whether a very\ndifferent kind of woman might not do just as well, or a great deal\nbetter: whether Fanny herself were not growing as dear, as important to\nhim in all her smiles and all her ways, as Mary Crawford had ever been;\nand whether it might not be a possible, a hopeful undertaking to\npersuade her that her warm and sisterly regard for him would be\nfoundation enough for wedded love."

Loving, guiding, protecting her, as he had\nbeen doing ever since her being ten years old, her mind in so great a\ndegree formed by his care, and her comfort depending on his kindness,\nan object to him of such close and peculiar interest, dearer by all his\nown importance with her than any one else at Mansfield, what was there\nnow to add, but that he should learn to prefer soft light eyes to\nsparkling dark ones. And being always with her, and always talking\nconfidentially, and his feelings exactly in that favourable state which\na recent disappointment gives, those soft light eyes could not be very\nlong in obtaining the pre-eminence."

    "text": "Having once set out, and felt that he had done so on this road to\nhappiness, there was nothing on the side of prudence to stop him or\nmake his progress slow; no doubts of her deserving, no fears of\nopposition of taste, no need of drawing new hopes of happiness from\ndissimilarity of temper. Her mind, disposition, opinions, and habits\nwanted no half-concealment, no self-deception on the present, no\nreliance on future improvement. Even in the midst of his late\ninfatuation, he had acknowledged Fanny’s mental superiority. What must\nbe his sense of it now, therefore? She was of course only too good for\nhim; but as nobody minds having what is too good for them, he was very\nsteadily earnest in the pursuit of the blessing, and it was not\npossible that encouragement from her should be long wanting. Timid,\nanxious, doubting as she was, it was still impossible that such\ntenderness as hers should not, at times, hold out the strongest hope of\nsuccess, though it remained for a later period to tell him the whole\ndelightful and astonishing truth. His happiness in knowing himself to\nhave been so long the beloved of such a heart, must have been great\nenough to warrant any strength of language in which he could clothe it\nto her or to himself; it must have been a delightful happiness. But\nthere was happiness elsewhere which no description can reach. Let no\none presume to give the feelings of a young woman on receiving the\nassurance of that affection of which she has scarcely allowed herself\nto entertain a hope."

But it was possible to part with her, because\nSusan remained to supply her place. Susan became the stationary niece,\ndelighted to be so; and equally well adapted for it by a readiness of\nmind, and an inclination for usefulness, as Fanny had been by sweetness\nof temper, and strong feelings of gratitude. Susan could never be\nspared. First as a comfort to Fanny, then as an auxiliary, and last as\nher substitute, she was established at Mansfield, with every appearance\nof equal permanency. Her more fearless disposition and happier nerves\nmade everything easy to her there. With quickness in understanding the\ntempers of those she had to deal with, and no natural timidity to\nrestrain any consequent wishes, she was soon welcome and useful to all;\nand after Fanny’s removal succeeded so naturally to her influence over\nthe hourly comfort of her aunt, as gradually to become, perhaps, the\nmost beloved of the two. In _her_ usefulness, in Fanny’s excellence, in\nWilliam’s continued good conduct and rising fame, and in the general\nwell-doing and success of the other members of the family, all\nassisting to advance each other, and doing credit to his countenance\nand aid, Sir Thomas saw repeated, and for ever repeated, reason to\nrejoice in what he had done for them all, and acknowledge the\nadvantages of early hardship and discipline, and the consciousness of\nbeing born to struggle and endure."
