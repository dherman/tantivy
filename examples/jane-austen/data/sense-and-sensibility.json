    "text": "The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate\nwas large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of\ntheir property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so\nrespectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their\nsurrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single\nman, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his\nlife, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her\ndeath, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great\nalteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received\ninto his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal\ninheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to\nbequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and their\nchildren, the old Gentleman’s days were comfortably spent. His\nattachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and\nMrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from\ninterest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid\ncomfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the\nchildren added a relish to his existence."

    "text": "By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present\nlady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was\namply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,\nand half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own\nmarriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his\nwealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not\nso really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent\nof what might arise to them from their father’s inheriting that\nproperty, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their\nfather only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the\nremaining moiety of his first wife’s fortune was also secured to her\nchild, and he had only a life-interest in it."

    "text": "The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other\nwill, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so\nunjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;—but\nhe left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the\nbequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife\nand daughters than for himself or his son;—but to his son, and his\nson’s son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as\nto leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear\nto him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or\nby any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up for the\nbenefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and\nmother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by\nsuch attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three\nyears old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his\nown way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh\nall the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received\nfrom his niece and her daughters. He meant not to be unkind, however,\nand, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a\nthousand pounds a-piece."

But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was\nhis only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten\nthousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for\nhis widow and daughters."

I’ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,\nit would be very strange and unreasonable if he did. Do but consider,\nmy dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law\nand her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds,\nbesides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which\nbrings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will\npay their mother for their board out of it. Altogether, they will have\nfive hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want\nfor more than that?—They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will be\nnothing at all. They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly any\nservants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of any\nkind! Only conceive how comfortable they will be! Five hundred a year!\nI am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as to\nyour giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it. They will be\nmuch more able to give _you_ something.”"

His\nunderstanding was good, and his education had given it solid\nimprovement. But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to\nanswer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him\ndistinguished—as—they hardly knew what. They wanted him to make a fine\nfigure in the world in some manner or other. His mother wished to\ninterest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to\nsee him connected with some of the great men of the day. Mrs. John\nDashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these\nsuperior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her\nambition to see him driving a barouche.

The excellence of his understanding and his\nprinciples can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps\nhim silent. You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth.\nBut of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have from\npeculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself. He and I\nhave been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been\nwholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother. I\nhave seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard\nhis opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, I\nventure to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of books\nexceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just and\ncorrect, and his taste delicate and pure. His abilities in every\nrespect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person. At\nfirst sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his person can\nhardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which are\nuncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is\nperceived. At present, I know him so well, that I think him really\nhandsome; or at least, almost so. What say you, Marianne?”"

In my heart I feel\nlittle—scarcely any doubt of his preference. But there are other points\nto be considered besides his inclination. He is very far from being\nindependent. What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from\nFanny’s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never\nbeen disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if\nEdward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in\nhis way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great\nfortune or high rank.”"

There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which, if\nit did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost as\nunpromising. A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need not\ngive him more than inquietude. It would not be likely to produce that\ndejection of mind which frequently attended him. A more reasonable\ncause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the\nindulgence of his affection. She knew that his mother neither behaved\nto him so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give him\nany assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictly\nattending to her views for his aggrandizement. With such a knowledge as\nthis, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject. She was\nfar from depending on that result of his preference of her, which her\nmother and sister still considered as certain. Nay, the longer they\nwere together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and\nsometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more\nthan friendship."

It was the\noffer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of\nher own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire. The\nletter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit\nof friendly accommodation. He understood that she was in need of a\ndwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,\nhe assured her that everything should be done to it which she might\nthink necessary, if the situation pleased her. He earnestly pressed\nher, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come with\nher daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from\nwhence she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houses\nwere in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortable\nto her. He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of\nhis letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of\ngiving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was\nsuffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer\nconnections. She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry. Her\nresolution was formed as she read. The situation of Barton, in a county\nso far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours\nbefore, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every\npossible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first\nrecommendation. To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an\nevil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison of\nthe misery of continuing her daughter-in-law’s guest; and to remove for\never from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or\nvisit it while such a woman was its mistress. She instantly wrote Sir\nJohn Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance\nof his proposal; and then hastened to show both letters to her\ndaughters, that she might be secure of their approbation before her\nanswer were sent."

    "text": "They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much of\ntheir comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her appearance\nwas favourable to their wishes. Lady Middleton was not more than six or\nseven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall and striking,\nand her address graceful. Her manners had all the elegance which her\nhusband’s wanted. But they would have been improved by some share of\nhis frankness and warmth; and her visit was long enough to detract\nsomething from their first admiration, by showing that, though\nperfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for\nherself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark."

On every formal visit a child ought to be of\nthe party, by way of provision for discourse. In the present case it\ntook up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his\nfather or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for of\ncourse every body differed, and every body was astonished at the\nopinion of the others."

The ladies had\npassed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from\ntheir view at home by the projection of a hill. The house was large and\nhandsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and\nelegance. The former was for Sir John’s gratification, the latter for\nthat of his lady. They were scarcely ever without some friends staying\nwith them in the house, and they kept more company of every kind than\nany other family in the neighbourhood. It was necessary to the\nhappiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outward\nbehaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of\ntalent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with\nsuch as society produced, within a very narrow compass. Sir John was a\nsportsman, Lady Middleton a mother. He hunted and shot, and she\nhumoured her children; and these were their only resources. Lady\nMiddleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the\nyear round, while Sir John’s independent employments were in existence\nonly half the time. Continual engagements at home and abroad, however,\nsupplied all the deficiencies of nature and education; supported the\ngood spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise to the good breeding of his\nwife."

He was a blessing to all the juvenile part\nof the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever forming parties to\neat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his private balls\nwere numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the\nunsatiable appetite of fifteen."

The friendliness of his\ndisposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation\nmight be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate. In\nshowing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction\nof a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his\ncottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman,\nthough he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is\nnot often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a\nresidence within his own manor."

He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the\nparty, and could assure them it should never happen so again. He had\nbeen to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some\naddition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was full\nof engagements. Luckily Lady Middleton’s mother had arrived at Barton\nwithin the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman,\nhe hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might\nimagine.

The high\ndowns which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to\nseek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy\nalternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior\nbeauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one\nmemorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshine\nof a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which the\nsettled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned. The weather was\nnot tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their\nbook, in spite of Marianne’s declaration that the day would be\nlastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off\nfrom their hills; and the two girls set off together."

His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn\nfor the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the\nhouse with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of\nthought which particularly recommended the action to her. Every\ncircumstance belonging to him was interesting. His name was good, his\nresidence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that\nof all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.

Their attention and wit were drawn off\nto his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other had\nincurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his feelings\nbegan really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility.\nElinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments\nwhich Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction, were now\nactually excited by her sister; and that however a general resemblance\nof disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr.\nWilloughby, an equally striking opposition of character was no\nhindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon. She saw it with concern;\nfor what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to a\nvery lively one of five and twenty? and as she could not even wish him\nsuccessful, she heartily wished him indifferent. She liked him—in spite\nof his gravity and reserve, she beheld in him an object of interest.\nHis manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve appeared rather\nthe result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess\nof temper. Sir John had dropped hints of past injuries and\ndisappointments, which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate\nman, and she regarded him with respect and compassion."

Neither\nLady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the conversation\nshe missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker, and from the\nfirst had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share\nof her discourse. She had already repeated her own history to Elinor\nthree or four times; and had Elinor’s memory been equal to her means of\nimprovement, she might have known very early in their acquaintance all\nthe particulars of Mr. Jennings’s last illness, and what he said to his\nwife a few minutes before he died. Lady Middleton was more agreeable\nthan her mother only in being more silent. Elinor needed little\nobservation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner\nwith which sense had nothing to do. Towards her husband and mother she\nwas the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore neither to be\nlooked for nor desired. She had nothing to say one day that she had not\nsaid the day before. Her insipidity was invariable, for even her\nspirits were always the same; and though she did not oppose the parties\narranged by her husband, provided every thing were conducted in style\nand her two eldest children attended her, she never appeared to receive\nmore enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at\nhome;—and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others,\nby any share in their conversation, that they were sometimes only\nreminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her\ntroublesome boys."

Elinor then\nventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a\nman so little, or at least so lately known to her. This was too much."

It is not time or opportunity that is\nto determine intimacy;—it is disposition alone. Seven years would be\ninsufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven\ndays are more than enough for others. I should hold myself guilty of\ngreater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from\nWilloughby. Of John I know very little, though we have lived together\nfor years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.”"

If her sisters intended to walk on the downs,\nshe directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of the\nvalley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never be\nfound when the others set off. But at length she was secured by the\nexertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.\nThey walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,\nfor Marianne’s _mind_ could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied\nwith gaining one point, would not then attempt more. Beyond the\nentrance of the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less\nwild and more open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled\non first coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point,\nthey stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed\nthe distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they had\nnever happened to reach in any of their walks before."

Marianne\nsaw and listened with increasing surprise. She began almost to feel a\ndislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her, by\ncarrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a\ncontrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect."

I shall call hills steep, which ought to be\nbold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and\nrugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be\nindistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere. You must be\nsatisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give. I call it a very\nfine country—the hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber,\nand the valley looks comfortable and snug—with rich meadows and several\nneat farm houses scattered here and there. It exactly answers my idea\nof a fine country, because it unites beauty with utility—and I dare say\nit is a picturesque one too, because you admire it; I can easily\nbelieve it to be full of rocks and promontories, grey moss and brush\nwood, but these are all lost on me.

His want of spirits, of openness,\nand of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want of\nindependence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars’s disposition\nand designs. The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose\nin leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination, the same\ninevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother. The old\nwell-established grievance of duty against will, parent against child,\nwas the cause of all. She would have been glad to know when these\ndifficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,—when Mrs.\nFerrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy. But\nfrom such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal\nof her confidence in Edward’s affection, to the remembrance of every\nmark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton, and\nabove all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round\nhis finger."

The\nlaw was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had chambers\nin the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and\ndrove about town in very knowing gigs. But I had no inclination for the\nlaw, even in this less abstruse study of it, which my family approved.\nAs for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the\nsubject was first started to enter it—and, at length, as there was no\nnecessity for my having any profession at all, as I might be as dashing\nand expensive without a red coat on my back as with one, idleness was\npronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable, and a\nyoung man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy\nas to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing.

He entered the room with a\nlook of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, without\nspeaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their\napartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read\nit as long as he staid."

Their being her relations too made it so much the\nworse; and Mrs. Jennings’s attempts at consolation were therefore\nunfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care about\ntheir being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put\nup with one another. As it was impossible, however, now to prevent\ntheir coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, with\nall the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with merely\ngiving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times\nevery day."

Their dress was very smart, their manners very civil,\nthey were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the furniture,\nand they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady\nMiddleton’s good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had\nbeen an hour at the Park. She declared them to be very agreeable girls\nindeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration. Sir John’s\nconfidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise, and he\nset off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss\nSteeles’ arrival, and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls\nin the world. From such commendation as this, however, there was not\nmuch to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the\nworld were to be met with in every part of England, under every\npossible variation of form, face, temper and understanding. Sir John\nwanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his\nguests. Benevolent, philanthropic man! It was painful to him even to\nkeep a third cousin to himself."

Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon\nallowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw with what\nconstant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable\nto Lady Middleton. With her children they were in continual raptures,\nextolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their\nwhims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate\ndemands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of\nwhatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing,\nor in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her\nappearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.\nFortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fond\nmother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most\nrapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands\nare exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the excessive\naffection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were\nviewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or\ndistrust. She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent\nencroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.\nShe saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, their\nwork-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and felt\nno doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment. It suggested no other\nsurprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,\nwithout claiming a share in what was passing."

The mother’s consternation was\nexcessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and\nevery thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, which\naffection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little\nsufferer. She was seated in her mother’s lap, covered with kisses, her\nwound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who was\non her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by\nthe other. With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise to\ncease crying. She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her two\nbrothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings were\nineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of\nsimilar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been\nsuccessfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly\nproposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of\nscreams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that\nit would not be rejected. She was carried out of the room therefore in\nher mother’s arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boys chose\nto follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind,\nthe four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not\nknown for many hours."

What Lucy had asserted to\nbe true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt; supported\nas it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs, and\ncontradicted by nothing but her own wishes. Their opportunity of\nacquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest,\nat once indisputable and alarming; and Edward’s visit near Plymouth,\nhis melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at his own prospects,\nhis uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the\nMiss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which had\noften surprised her, the picture, the letter, the ring, formed\naltogether such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear of\ncondemning him unfairly, and established as a fact, which no partiality\ncould set aside, his ill-treatment of herself.—Her resentment of such\nbehaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe, for a short time\nmade her feel only for herself; but other ideas, other considerations,\nsoon arose. Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her? Had he feigned\na regard for her which he did not feel? Was his engagement to Lucy an\nengagement of the heart? No; whatever it might once have been, she\ncould not believe it such at present. His affection was all her own.\nShe could not be deceived in that. Her mother, sisters, Fanny, all had\nbeen conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not an illusion\nof her own vanity. He certainly loved her. What a softener of the heart\nwas this persuasion! How much could it not tempt her to forgive! He had\nbeen blamable, highly blamable, in remaining at Norland after he first\nfelt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be. In that, he\ncould not be defended; but if he had injured her, how much more had he\ninjured himself; if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless. His\nimprudence had made her miserable for a while; but it seemed to have\ndeprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise. She might in\ntime regain tranquillity; but _he_, what had he to look forward to?\nCould he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he, were his\naffection for herself out of the question, with his integrity, his\ndelicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with a wife like\nher—illiterate, artful, and selfish?"

She wanted to hear many particulars of their\nengagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what\nLucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her\ndeclaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to\nconvince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and her\ncalmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested in\nit than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary\nagitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least\ndoubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very\nprobable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her\npraise, not merely from Lucy’s assertion, but from her venturing to\ntrust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so\nconfessedly and evidently important. And even Sir John’s joking\nintelligence must have had some weight. But indeed, while Elinor\nremained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by\nEdward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it\nnatural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very\nconfidence was a proof. What other reason for the disclosure of the\naffair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of\nLucy’s superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in future?\nShe had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival’s\nintentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every\nprinciple of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own affection\nfor Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny\nherself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was\nunwounded. And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on\nthe subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust her own\nability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure."

Elinor,\nwithout observing the varying complexion of her sister, and the\nanimated look which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave\na grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she believed herself\nto be speaking their united inclinations. The reason alleged was their\ndetermined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the\nyear.

The tea\nthings were brought in, and already had Marianne been disappointed more\nthan once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly\nheard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house, Elinor\nfelt secure of its announcing Willoughby’s approach, and Marianne,\nstarting up, moved towards the door. Every thing was silent; this could\nnot be borne many seconds; she opened the door, advanced a few steps\ntowards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returned into\nthe room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him\nwould naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant\nshe could not help exclaiming, “Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it\nis!” and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms, when\nColonel Brandon appeared."

She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him, that he even\nobserved Marianne as she quitted the room, with such astonishment and\nconcern, as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded\ntowards herself."

It would grieve me indeed to\nbe obliged to think ill of you; but if I am to do it, if I am to learn\nthat you are not what we have hitherto believed you, that your regard\nfor us all was insincere, that your behaviour to me was intended only\nto deceive, let it be told as soon as possible.

Two ladies\nwere waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other\nan account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting\nconcealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all. The name of\nWilloughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my\nattention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing\nwas now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey—it was\nno longer to be a secret—it would take place even within a few weeks,\nwith many particulars of preparations and other matters. One thing,\nespecially, I remember, because it served to identify the man still\nmore:—as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe Magna,\nhis seat in Somersetshire. My astonishment!—but it would be impossible\nto describe what I felt. The communicative lady I learnt, on inquiry,\nfor I stayed in the shop till they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, and\nthat, as I have been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey’s\nguardian.”"

    "text": "“If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender\nrecollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well\nin mind as person. The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of\nfancy and spirits. This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan\nfrom her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. Our ages\nwere nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were playfellows\nand friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza; and\nmy affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from\nmy present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me incapable\nof having ever felt. Hers, for me, was, I believe, fervent as the\nattachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was, though from a\ndifferent cause, no less unfortunate. At seventeen she was lost to me\nfor ever. She was married—married against her inclination to my\nbrother. Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered.\nAnd this, I fear, is all that can be said for the conduct of one, who\nwas at once her uncle and guardian. My brother did not deserve her; he\ndid not even love her. I had hoped that her regard for me would support\nher under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at last the\nmisery of her situation, for she experienced great unkindness, overcame\nall her resolution, and though she had promised me that nothing—but how\nblindly I relate! I have never told you how this was brought on. We\nwere within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland. The\ntreachery, or the folly, of my cousin’s maid betrayed us. I was\nbanished to the house of a relation far distant, and she was allowed no\nliberty, no society, no amusement, till my father’s point was gained. I\nhad depended on her fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe\none—but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few\nmonths must have reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have now\nto lament it. This however was not the case. My brother had no regard\nfor her; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been, and from\nthe first he treated her unkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind\nso young, so lively, so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon’s, was but too\nnatural. She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her\nsituation; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those\nregrets which the remembrance of me occasioned. But can we wonder that,\nwith such a husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to\nadvise or restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after\ntheir marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she\nshould fall? Had I remained in England, perhaps—but I meant to promote\nthe happiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that\npurpose had procured my exchange. The shock which her marriage had\ngiven me,” he continued, in a voice of great agitation, “was of\ntrifling weight—was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two\nyears afterwards, of her divorce. It was _that_ which threw this\ngloom,—even now the recollection of what I suffered—”"

I could\nnot trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to\nfear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of\nsin. Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, nor\nsufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my\nbrother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months\nbefore to another person. He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it,\nthat her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to\ndispose of it for some immediate relief. At last, however, and after I\nhad been six months in England, I _did_ find her. Regard for a former\nservant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to\nvisit him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt; and\nthere, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my\nunfortunate sister. So altered—so faded—worn down by acute suffering of\nevery kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure\nbefore me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,\non whom I had once doted. What I endured in so beholding her—but I have\nno right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it—I have\npained you too much already. That she was, to all appearance, in the\nlast stage of a consumption, was—yes, in such a situation it was my\ngreatest comfort. Life could do nothing for her, beyond giving time for\na better preparation for death; and that was given. I saw her placed in\ncomfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visited her every\nday during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her last\nmoments.”"

    "text": "“Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,” said he, “by the resemblance\nI have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation. Their fates,\ntheir fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet\ndisposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a happier\nmarriage, she might have been all that you will live to see the other\nbe. But to what does all this lead? I seem to have been distressing you\nfor nothing. Ah! Miss Dashwood—a subject such as this—untouched for\nfourteen years—it is dangerous to handle it at all! I _will_ be more\ncollected—more concise. She left to my care her only child, a little\ngirl, the offspring of her first guilty connection, who was then about\nthree years old. She loved the child, and had always kept it with her.\nIt was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly would I have\ndischarged it in the strictest sense, by watching over her education\nmyself, had the nature of our situations allowed it; but I had no\nfamily, no home; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school. I\nsaw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my brother,\n(which happened about five years ago, and which left to me the\npossession of the family property,) she visited me at Delaford. I\ncalled her a distant relation; but I am well aware that I have in\ngeneral been suspected of a much nearer connection with her. It is now\nthree years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,) that I\nremoved her from school, to place her under the care of a very\nrespectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of four\nor five other girls of about the same time of life; and for two years I\nhad every reason to be pleased with her situation. But last February,\nalmost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared. I had allowed her,\n(imprudently, as it has since turned out,) at her earnest desire, to go\nto Bath with one of her young friends, who was attending her father\nthere for his health. I knew him to be a very good sort of man, and I\nthought well of his daughter—better than she deserved, for, with a most\nobstinate and ill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would give no\nclue, though she certainly knew all. He, her father, a well-meaning,\nbut not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe, give no\ninformation; for he had been generally confined to the house, while the\ngirls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they\nchose; and he tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced\nhimself, of his daughter’s being entirely unconcerned in the business.\nIn short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone; all the rest,\nfor eight long months, was left to conjecture. What I thought, what I\nfeared, may be imagined; and what I suffered too.”"

Little did Mr. Willoughby\nimagine, I suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility in\nbreaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one whom\nhe had made poor and miserable; but _had_ he known it, what would it\nhave availed? Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles\nof your sister? No, he had already done that, which no man who _can_\nfeel for another would do. He had left the girl whose youth and\ninnocence he had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with\nno creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address! He\nhad left her, promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor\nrelieved her.”"

My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then; but now\nyou will comprehend it. To suffer you all to be so deceived; to see\nyour sister—but what could I do? I had no hope of interfering with\nsuccess; and sometimes I thought your sister’s influence might yet\nreclaim him. But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what\nwere his designs on her. Whatever they may have been, however, she may\nnow, and hereafter doubtless _will_ turn with gratitude towards her own\ncondition, when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she\nconsiders the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and\npictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong, still as\nstrong as her own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which\nmust attend her through life. Surely this comparison must have its use\nwith her. She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing. They proceed\nfrom no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace. On the contrary, every\nfriend must be made still more her friend by them. Concern for her\nunhappiness, and respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen\nevery attachment. Use your own discretion, however, in communicating to\nher what I have told you. You must know best what will be its effect;\nbut had I not seriously, and from my heart believed it might be of\nservice, might lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered myself to\ntrouble you with this account of my family afflictions, with a recital\nwhich may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of\nothers.”"

But\nthough this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt\n_was_ carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the\neffect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called,\nin her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of\ncompassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less violently\nirritated than before, she did not see her less wretched. Her mind did\nbecome settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection. She felt the\nloss of Willoughby’s character yet more heavily than she had felt the\nloss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the\nmisery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his designs might\n_once_ have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits,\nthat she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to\nElinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to\nher sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most\nfrequent confession of them."

She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all means\nnot to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which,\nthough never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at\nleast five or six weeks. A variety of occupations, of objects, and of\ncompany, which could not be procured at Barton, would be inevitable\nthere, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at times, into some\ninterest beyond herself, and even into some amusement, much as the\nideas of both might now be spurned by her."

But some of those little\nattentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix\nhim, in spite of himself. And there can be no reason why you should not\ntry for him. It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your\nside—in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is quite\nout of the question, the objections are insurmountable—you have too\nmuch sense not to see all that. Colonel Brandon must be the man; and no\ncivility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and\nyour family. It is a match that must give universal satisfaction. In\nshort, it is a kind of thing that”—lowering his voice to an important\nwhisper—“will be exceedingly welcome to _all parties_.” Recollecting\nhimself, however, he added, “That is, I mean to say—your friends are\nall truly anxious to see you well settled; Fanny particularly, for she\nhas your interest very much at heart, I assure you. And her mother too,\nMrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman, I am sure it would give her\ngreat pleasure; she said as much the other day.”"

Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited\nlikewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who,\nalways glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager\ncivilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure. They were to\nmeet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to\nbe of the party. The expectation of seeing _her_, however, was enough\nto make her interested in the engagement; for though she could now meet\nEdward’s mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to\nattend such an introduction, though she could now see her with perfect\nindifference as to her opinion of herself, her desire of being in\ncompany with Mrs. Ferrars, her curiosity to know what she was like, was\nas lively as ever."

For their\nown comfort they would much rather have remained, at least all the\nmorning, in Mrs. Jennings’s house; but it was not a thing to be urged\nagainst the wishes of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over\nto Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in\nfact was as little valued, as it was professedly sought."

Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the\nthree, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her to\nit entirely. Would either of them only have given her a full and minute\naccount of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, she\nwould have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best\nplace by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned. But\nthis conciliation was not granted; for though she often threw out\nexpressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt\na reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect was\nproduced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust in\nthe latter. An effort even yet lighter might have made her their\nfriend. Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor! But so\nlittle were they, any more than the others, inclined to oblige her,\nthat if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole day without\nhearing any other raillery on the subject, than what she was kind\nenough to bestow on herself."

It so happened that while her two sisters\nwith Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, another\nof her acquaintance had dropt in—a circumstance in itself not\napparently likely to produce evil to her. But while the imaginations of\nother people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our\nconduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one’s happiness\nmust in some measure be always at the mercy of chance. In the present\ninstance, this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun\ntruth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss\nDashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood’s sisters, she\nimmediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this\nmisconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of\ninvitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a small\nmusical party at her house. The consequence of which was, that Mrs.\nJohn Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great\ninconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what\nwas still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing\nto treat them with attention: and who could tell that they might not\nexpect to go out with her a second time? The power of disappointing\nthem, it was true, must always be hers. But that was not enough; for\nwhen people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be\nwrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from\nthem."

And so, just as he was going away again, it\ncame into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of\nit, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news. So upon\nthat, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know\nsomething or other, and at last he said in a whisper, ‘For fear any\nunpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to\ntheir sister’s indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I\nbelieve there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will\ndo very well.’”"

    "text": "“That is exactly what I said, my dear. ‘Lord!’ says I, ‘is Mrs.\nDashwood ill?’ So then it all came out; and the long and the short of\nthe matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this. Mr. Edward Ferrars,\nthe very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it\nturns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr.\nEdward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my\ncousin Lucy!—There’s for you, my dear! And not a creature knowing a\nsyllable of the matter, except Nancy! Could you have believed such a\nthing possible? There is no great wonder in their liking one another;\nbut that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody\nsuspect it! _That_ is strange! I never happened to see them together,\nor I am sure I should have found it out directly. Well, and so this was\nkept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your\nbrother or sister suspected a word of the matter: till this very\nmorning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but no\nconjurer, popt it all out. ‘Lord!’ thinks she to herself, ‘they are all\nso fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;’ and\nso, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone at her\ncarpet-work, little suspecting what was to come—for she had just been\nsaying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she thought to\nmake a match between Edward and some Lord’s daughter or other, I forget\nwho. So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride.\nShe fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams as\nreached your brother’s ears, as he was sitting in his own dressing-room\ndown stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the\ncountry. So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for\nLucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on.\nPoor soul! I pity _her_. And I must say, I think she was used very\nhardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her into\na fainting fit. Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly; and\nyour brother, he walked about the room, and said he did not know what\nto do. Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in\nthe house, and your brother was forced to go down upon _his_ knees too,\nto persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes.\n_Then_ she fell into hysterics again, and he was so frightened that he\nwould send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this\nuproar. The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins\naway, and they were just stepping in as he came off; poor Lucy in such\na condition, he says, she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost\nas bad. I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope,\nwith all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her. Lord! what a\ntaking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it! To have his love\nused so scornfully! for they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well\nhe may. I should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest\npassion!—and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same. He and I had a great\ndeal of talk about it; and the best of all is, that he is gone back\nagain to Harley Street, that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is\ntold of it, for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the\nhouse, for your sister was sure _she_ would be in hysterics too; and so\nshe may, for what I care. I have no pity for either of them. I have no\nnotion of people’s making such a to-do about money and greatness. There\nis no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I\nam sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son, and though\nLucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better than any body how to\nmake the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only\nallow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance\nwith it as any body else would with eight. Lord! how snug they might\nlive in such another cottage as yours—or a little bigger—with two\nmaids, and two men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for\nmy Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly.”"

It was told me,—it\nwas in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose prior\nengagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with\ntriumph. This person’s suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose, by\nendeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply\ninterested; and it has not been only once; I have had her hopes and\nexultation to listen to again and again. I have known myself to be\ndivided from Edward for ever, without hearing one circumstance that\ncould make me less desire the connection. Nothing has proved him\nunworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.

Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday. But I\nwould not alarm you too much. Donavan says there is nothing materially\nto be apprehended; her constitution is a good one, and her resolution\nequal to any thing. She has borne it all, with the fortitude of an\nangel! She says she never shall think well of anybody again; and one\ncannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!—meeting with such\ningratitude, where so much kindness had been shown, so much confidence\nhad been placed! It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart, that\nshe had asked these young women to her house; merely because she\nthought they deserved some attention, were harmless, well-behaved\ngirls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we both wished\nvery much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us, while your\nkind friend there, was attending her daughter. And now to be so\nrewarded! ‘I wish, with all my heart,’ says poor Fanny in her\naffectionate way, ‘that we had asked your sisters instead of them.’”"

While she with the truest affection had been\nplanning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed that\nhe could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!—such a\nsuspicion could never have entered her head! If she suspected _any_\nprepossession elsewhere, it could not be in _that_ quarter. ‘_There_,\nto be sure,’ said she, ‘I might have thought myself safe.’ She was\nquite in an agony. We consulted together, however, as to what should be\ndone, and at last she determined to send for Edward. He came. But I am\nsorry to relate what ensued. All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make\nhim put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose\nby my arguments, and Fanny’s entreaties, was of no avail. Duty,\naffection, every thing was disregarded. I never thought Edward so\nstubborn, so unfeeling before. His mother explained to him her liberal\ndesigns, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle\non him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings in a good\nthousand a-year; offered even, when matters grew desperate, to make it\ntwelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if he still persisted in\nthis low connection, represented to him the certain penury that must\nattend the match. His own two thousand pounds she protested should be\nhis all; she would never see him again; and so far would she be from\naffording him the smallest assistance, that if he were to enter into\nany profession with a view of better support, she would do all in her\npower to prevent him advancing in it.”"

    "text": "“Oh, did not you? But it _was_ said, I know, very well, and by more\nthan one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses\ncould expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with\nthirty thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had nothing\nat all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. And besides that, my\ncousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he was\nafraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us\nfor three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in\nmy heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your\nbrother’s Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday,\nFriday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him. Once\nLucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits rose against that.\nHowever this morning he came just as we came home from church; and then\nit all came out, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street,\nand been talked to by his mother and all of them, and how he had\ndeclared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but\nLucy would he have. And how he had been so worried by what passed, that\nas soon as he had went away from his mother’s house, he had got upon\nhis horse, and rid into the country, some where or other; and how he\nhad stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get\nthe better of it. And after thinking it all over and over again, he\nsaid, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at\nall, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, because\nit must be for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds,\nand no hope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders, as he\nhad some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they\nto live upon that?—He could not bear to think of her doing no better,\nand so he begged, if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to\nthe matter directly, and leave him shift for himself. I heard him say\nall this as plain as could possibly be. And it was entirely for _her_\nsake, and upon _her_ account, that he said a word about being off, and\nnot upon his own. I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of\nbeing tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any thing\nlike it. But, to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of\ntalking; so she told him directly (with a great deal about sweet and\nlove, you know, and all that—Oh, la! one can’t repeat such kind of\nthings you know)—she told him directly, she had not the least mind in\nthe world to be off, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how\nlittle so ever he might have, she should be very glad to have it all,\nyou know, or something of the kind. So then he was monstrous happy, and\ntalked on some time about what they should do, and they agreed he\nshould take orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he\ngot a living. And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin\ncalled from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach, and\nwould take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into\nthe room and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but\nshe did not care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put on a\npair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.”"

She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts\ntowards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes to\ntheir kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her\ngood-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them from\nhome yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more\neligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about\nthe end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with both\nher friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with\nthem. This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy\nof Miss Dashwood;—but it was inforced with so much real politeness by\nMr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment of his\nmanners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy,\ninduced her to accept it with pleasure."

What Elinor said in reply she\ncould not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips, that she\ndid not think _that_ any material objection; and Mrs. Jennings\ncommended her in her heart for being so honest. They then talked on for\na few minutes longer without her catching a syllable, when another\nlucky stop in Marianne’s performance brought her these words in the\nColonel’s calm voice,—"

Her\nemotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different\ncause; but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, might have\na share in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence, and\nher gratitude for the particular friendship, which together prompted\nColonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmly expressed.\nShe thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of Edward’s principles\nand disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve; and\npromised to undertake the commission with pleasure, if it were really\nhis wish to put off so agreeable an office to another. But at the same\ntime, she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it\nas himself. It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give\nEdward the pain of receiving an obligation from _her_, she would have\nbeen very glad to be spared herself; but Colonel Brandon, on motives of\nequal delicacy, declining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its\nbeing given through her means, that she would not on any account make\nfarther opposition. Edward, she believed, was still in town, and\nfortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele. She could\nundertake therefore to inform him of it, in the course of the day.\nAfter this had been settled, Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own\nadvantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour, and\n_then_ it was that he mentioned with regret, that the house was small\nand indifferent; an evil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed\nher to do, made very light of, at least as far as regarded its size."

Allow me to congratulate you on having so\nrespectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that the\nliving—it is about two hundred a-year—were much more considerable, and\nsuch as might better enable you to—as might be more than a temporary\naccommodation to yourself—such, in short, as might establish all your\nviews of happiness.”"

To be sure it was pitiable enough; but upon my soul, I\nbelieve he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom; and I declare and\nprotest to you I never was so shocked in my life, as when it all burst\nforth. I could not believe it. My mother was the first person who told\nme of it; and I, feeling myself called on to act with resolution,\nimmediately said to her, ‘My dear madam, I do not know what you may\nintend to do on the occasion, but as for myself, I must say, that if\nEdward does marry this young woman, _I_ never will see him again.’ That\nwas what I said immediately. I was most uncommonly shocked, indeed!\nPoor Edward! he has done for himself completely,—shut himself out for\never from all decent society!

She found him,\nhowever, perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,\nand only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother; she found him\nvery capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented from\nbeing so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much\nsuperior to people in general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs.\nJennings and Charlotte. For the rest of his character and habits, they\nwere marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at all\nunusual in his sex and time of life. He was nice in his eating,\nuncertain in his hours; fond of his child, though affecting to slight\nit; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have been\ndevoted to business. She liked him, however, upon the whole, much\nbetter than she had expected, and in her heart was not sorry that she\ncould like him no more;—not sorry to be driven by the observation of\nhis Epicurism, his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with\ncomplacency on the remembrance of Edward’s generous temper, simple\ntaste, and diffident feelings."

Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination, to\nacknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from\nindulging a thought of its continuance;—and Elinor, conning over every\ninjunction of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope. But it was\ntoo late. Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious\nflutter, she bent over her sister to watch—she hardly knew for what.\nHalf an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her.\nOthers even arose to confirm it. Her breath, her skin, her lips, all\nflattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes\non her with a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope now\noppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity\ntill the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o’clock;—when his assurances,\nhis felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his\nexpectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy."

Every year since\nmy coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and\nthough the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free; yet\nthat event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been for\nsome time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a\nwoman of fortune. To attach myself to your sister, therefore, was not a\nthing to be thought of; and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty,\nwhich no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours, Miss Dashwood,\ncan ever reprobate too much,—I was acting in this manner, trying to\nengage her regard, without a thought of returning it. But one thing may\nbe said for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity, I did not\nknow the extent of the injury I meditated, because I did not _then_\nknow what it was to love. But have I ever known it? Well may it be\ndoubted; for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings\nto vanity, to avarice? or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?\nBut I have done it. To avoid a comparative poverty, which her affection\nand her society would have deprived of all its horrors, I have, by\nraising myself to affluence, lost every thing that could make it a\nblessing.”"

Yes, I found myself, by\ninsensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my\nlife were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly\nhonourable, and my feelings blameless. Even _then_, however, when fully\ndetermined on paying my addresses to her, I allowed myself most\nimproperly to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it, from an\nunwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were\nso greatly embarrassed. I will not reason here—nor will I stop for\n_you_ to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse than absurdity, of\nscrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound. The\nevent has proved, that I was a cunning fool, providing with great\ncircumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible\nand wretched for ever. At last, however, my resolution was taken, and I\nhad determined, as soon as I could engage her alone, to justify the\nattentions I had so invariably paid her, and openly assure her of an\naffection which I had already taken such pains to display. But in the\ninterim—in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass, before\nI could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private—a\ncircumstance occurred—an unlucky circumstance, to ruin all my\nresolution, and with it all my comfort. A discovery took place,”—here\nhe hesitated and looked down. “Mrs. Smith had somehow or other been\ninformed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interest it was to\ndeprive me of her favour, of an affair, a connection—but I need not\nexplain myself farther,” he added, looking at her with an heightened\ncolour and an enquiring eye,—“your particular intimacy—you have\nprobably heard the whole story long ago.”"

The matter itself I\ncould not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it. She was\npreviously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in\ngeneral, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention,\nthe very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my\npresent visit. In short, it ended in a total breach. By one measure I\nmight have saved myself. In the height of her morality, good woman! she\noffered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza. That could not\nbe—and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house. The\nnight following this affair—I was to go the next morning—was spent by\nme in deliberating on what my future conduct should be. The struggle\nwas great—but it ended too soon. My affection for Marianne, my thorough\nconviction of her attachment to me—it was all insufficient to outweigh\nthat dread of poverty, or get the better of those false ideas of the\nnecessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to feel, and\nexpensive society had increased. I had reason to believe myself secure\nof my present wife, if I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself\nto think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do. A\nheavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave Devonshire;—I was\nengaged to dine with you on that very day; some apology was therefore\nnecessary for my breaking this engagement. But whether I should write\nthis apology, or deliver it in person, was a point of long debate. To\nsee Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted whether I\ncould see her again, and keep to my resolution. In that point, however,\nI undervalued my own magnanimity, as the event declared; for I went, I\nsaw her, and saw her miserable, and left her miserable—and left her\nhoping never to see her again.”"

I avoided the Middletons as\nmuch as possible, as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an\nacquaintance in common. Not aware of their being in town, however, I\nblundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of his coming, and the\nday after I had called at Mrs. Jennings’s. He asked me to a party, a\ndance at his house in the evening. Had he _not_ told me as an\ninducement that you and your sister were to be there, I should have\nfelt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him. The next morning\nbrought another short note from Marianne—still affectionate, open,\nartless, confiding—everything that could make _my_ conduct most\nhateful. I could not answer it. I tried—but could not frame a sentence.\nBut I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day. If you _can_\npity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it was _then_. With my\nhead and heart full of your sister, I was forced to play the happy\nlover to another woman! Those three or four weeks were worse than all.\nWell, at last, as I need not tell you, you were forced on me; and what\na sweet figure I cut! what an evening of agony it was! Marianne,\nbeautiful as an angel on one side, calling me Willoughby in such a\ntone! Oh, God! holding out her hand to me, asking me for an\nexplanation, with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking\nsolicitude on my face! and Sophia, jealous as the devil on the other\nhand, looking all that was—Well, it does not signify; it is over now.\nSuch an evening! I ran away from you all as soon as I could; but not\nbefore I had seen Marianne’s sweet face as white as death. _That_ was\nthe last, last look I ever had of her; the last manner in which she\nappeared to me. It was a horrid sight! yet when I thought of her to-day\nas really dying, it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew\nexactly how she would appear to those, who saw her last in this world.\nShe was before me, constantly before me, as I travelled, in the same\nlook and hue.”"

As\nbluntly as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that Marianne\nDashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland—a letter that morning\nreceived from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent—the\nPalmers are all gone off in a fright, &c. I was too much shocked to be\nable to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir\nJohn. His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much of his\nill-will was done away, that when we parted, he almost shook me by the\nhand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy. What\nI felt on hearing that your sister was dying, and dying too, believing\nme the greatest villain upon earth, scorning, hating me in her latest\nmoments—for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been\nimputed? _One_ person I was sure would represent me as capable of\nanything—What I felt was dreadful!

Mrs. Dashwood _would_ sit up with her all night; and\nElinor, in compliance with her mother’s entreaty, went to bed. But the\nrest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of the most\nwearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by irritation of\nspirits. Willoughby, “poor Willoughby,” as she now allowed herself to\ncall him, was constantly in her thoughts; she would not but have heard\nhis vindication for the world, and now blamed, now acquitted herself\nfor having judged him so harshly before. But her promise of relating it\nto her sister was invariably painful. She dreaded the performance of\nit, dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be; doubted whether after\nsuch an explanation she could ever be happy with another; and for a\nmoment wished Willoughby a widower. Then, remembering Colonel Brandon,\nreproved herself, felt that to _his_ sufferings and _his_ constancy far\nmore than to his rival’s, the reward of her sister was due, and wished\nany thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby’s death."

There,\nhowever, he is quite mistaken. His age is only so much beyond hers as\nto be an advantage, as to make his character and principles fixed; and\nhis disposition, I am well convinced, is exactly the very one to make\nyour sister happy. And his person, his manners too, are all in his\nfavour. My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not so\nhandsome as Willoughby; but at the same time, there is something much\nmore pleasing in his countenance. There was always a something, if you\nremember, in Willoughby’s eyes at times, which I did not like.”"

In the whole of her subsequent\nmanner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable\nexertion; for no sooner had they entered their common sitting-room,\nthan Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute\nfirmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight of\nevery object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be\nconnected.—She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness,\nand though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed away without\nthe atonement of a smile. After dinner she would try her piano-forte.\nShe went to it; but the music on which her eye first rested was an\nopera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their\nfavourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his\nhand-writing.—That would not do.—She shook her head, put the music\naside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained of\nfeebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again; declaring\nhowever with firmness as she did so, that she should in future practice\nmuch."

It has given me leisure and calmness for serious\nrecollection. Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was\nperfectly able to reflect. I considered the past: I saw in my own\nbehaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last\nautumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of\nkindness to others. I saw that my own feelings had prepared my\nsufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me\nto the grave. My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by\nmyself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the\ntime to be wrong. Had I died, it would have been self-destruction. I\ndid not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such\nfeelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,—wonder\nthat the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for\natonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once. Had I\ndied, in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my\nfriend, my sister! You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my\nlatter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart! How should I\nhave lived in _your_ remembrance! My mother too! How could you have\nconsoled her! I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself. Whenever I\nlooked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing\nindulged. Every body seemed injured by me. The kindness, the unceasing\nkindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful contempt. To\nthe Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common\nacquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart\nhardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very\nattention. To John, to Fanny, yes, even to them, little as they\ndeserve, I had given less than their due. But you, you above all, above\nmy mother, had been wronged by me. I, and only I, knew your heart and\nits sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?—not to any compassion\nthat could benefit you or myself.—Your example was before me; but to\nwhat avail? Was I more considerate of you and your comfort? Did I\nimitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking any part\nin those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which\nyou had hitherto been left to discharge alone? No; not less when I knew\nyou to be unhappy, than when I had believed you at ease, did I turn\naway from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing\nsorrow to exist but with me, regretting only _that_ heart which had\ndeserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an\nunbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake.”"

This only need be said;—that when they all sat down to table at\nfour o’clock, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured his\nlady, engaged her mother’s consent, and was not only in the rapturous\nprofession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one\nof the happiest of men. His situation indeed was more than commonly\njoyful. He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell\nhis heart, and raise his spirits. He was released without any reproach\nto himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his misery, from\na woman whom he had long ceased to love;—and elevated at once to that\nsecurity with another, which he must have thought of almost with\ndespair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire. He was\nbrought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to happiness;—and\nthe change was openly spoken in such a genuine, flowing, grateful\ncheerfulness, as his friends had never witnessed in him before."

Had my\nmother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen\nfrom the care of Mr. Pratt, I think, nay, I am sure, it would never\nhave happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at the\ntime, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I then had\nany pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance\nfrom her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown the fancied\nattachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as in such case I\nmust have done. But instead of having any thing to do, instead of\nhaving any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any\nmyself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the first\ntwelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment, which\nbelonging to the university would have given me; for I was not entered\nat Oxford till I was nineteen. I had therefore nothing in the world to\ndo, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home\nin every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion in my\nbrother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me to\nbe very often at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, and\nwas always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part\nof my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared everything\nthat was amiable and obliging. She was pretty too—at least I thought so\n_then;_ and I had seen so little of other women, that I could make no\ncomparisons, and see no defects. Considering everything, therefore, I\nhope, foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since in every\nway been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable\npiece of folly.”"

Not a soul suspected anything of the\nmatter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul! came crying to me the day\nafter, in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, as well as not\nknowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her\nmoney before she went off to be married, on purpose we suppose to make\na show with, and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world; so I\nwas very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter,\nwhere she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess, in\nhopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor again.

The secrecy with which everything had been\ncarried on between them, was rationally treated as enormously\nheightening the crime, because, had any suspicion of it occurred to the\nothers, proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage;\nand he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy’s\nengagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled, than that she\nshould thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family.

When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and privately\nvisited her in Bartlett’s Buildings, it was only with the view imputed\nto him by his brother. He merely meant to persuade her to give up the\nengagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection\nof both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle\nthe matter. In that point, however, and that only, he erred; for though\nLucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in\n_time_, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to\nproduce this conviction. Some doubts always lingered in her mind when\nthey parted, which could only be removed by another half hour’s\ndiscourse with himself. His attendance was by this means secured, and\nthe rest followed in course. Instead of talking of Edward, they came\ngradually to talk only of Robert,—a subject on which he had always more\nto say than on any other, and in which she soon betrayed an interest\neven equal to his own; and in short, it became speedily evident to\nboth, that he had entirely supplanted his brother. He was proud of his\nconquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of marrying\nprivately without his mother’s consent. What immediately followed is\nknown. They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish; for she\nhad many relations and old acquaintances to cut—and he drew several\nplans for magnificent cottages;—and from thence returning to town,\nprocured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of\nasking it, which, at Lucy’s instigation, was adopted. The forgiveness,\nat first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert; and\nLucy, who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have\ntransgressed none, still remained some weeks longer unpardoned. But\nperseverance in humility of conduct and messages, in self-condemnation\nfor Robert’s offence, and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated\nwith, procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its\ngraciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest\nstate of affection and influence. Lucy became as necessary to Mrs.\nFerrars, as either Robert or Fanny; and while Edward was never\ncordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her, and Elinor,\nthough superior to her in fortune and birth, was spoken of as an\nintruder, _she_ was in every thing considered, and always openly\nacknowledged, to be a favourite child. They settled in town, received\nvery liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms\nimaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies and\nill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy, in which their\nhusbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent domestic\ndisagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed\nthe harmony in which they all lived together."

    "text": "Colonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him,\nbelieved he deserved to be;—in Marianne he was consoled for every past\naffliction;—her regard and her society restored his mind to animation,\nand his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own\nhappiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight of\neach observing friend. Marianne could never love by halves; and her\nwhole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, as it had\nonce been to Willoughby."

    "text": "Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his\npunishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of\nMrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, as\nthe source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he\nbehaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happy\nand rich. That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought its own\npunishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;—nor that he long thought\nof Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret. But that he\nwas for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or contracted an\nhabitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must not be\ndepended on—for he did neither. He lived to exert, and frequently to\nenjoy himself. His wife was not always out of humour, nor his home\nalways uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs, and in\nsporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic\nfelicity."
