This\nwas the page at which the favourite volume always opened:"

Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,\nsensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be\npardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had never\nrequired indulgence afterwards. She had humoured, or softened, or\nconcealed his failings, and promoted his real respectability for\nseventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world\nherself, had found enough in her duties, her friends, and her children,\nto attach her to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her\nwhen she was called on to quit them. Three girls, the two eldest\nsixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an\nawful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a\nconceited, silly father. She had, however, one very intimate friend, a\nsensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachment\nto herself, to settle close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on\nher kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help\nand maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had\nbeen anxiously giving her daughters."

Be it\nknown then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with one\nor two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),\nprided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters’ sake. For\none daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,\nwhich he had not been very much tempted to do. Elizabeth had succeeded,\nat sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother’s rights and\nconsequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself, her\ninfluence had always been great, and they had gone on together most\nhappily. His two other children were of very inferior value. Mary had\nacquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charles\nMusgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of\ncharacter, which must have placed her high with any people of real\nunderstanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no\nweight, her convenience was always to give way—she was only Anne."

For thirteen years\nhad she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at\nhome, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking\nimmediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and\ndining-rooms in the country. Thirteen winters’ revolving frosts had\nseen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood\nafforded, and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms, as she travelled\nup to London with her father, for a few weeks’ annual enjoyment of the\ngreat world. She had the remembrance of all this, she had the\nconsciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and\nsome apprehensions; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as\nhandsome as ever, but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and\nwould have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by\nbaronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two. Then might she again\ntake up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,\nbut now she liked it not. Always to be presented with the date of her\nown birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,\nmade the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it\nopen on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes, and\npushed it away."

There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her\nfeelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal. Yet so\nmiserably had he conducted himself, that though she was at this present\ntime (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons for his wife, she could\nnot admit him to be worth thinking of again. The disgrace of his first\nmarriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it\nperpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse;\nbut he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they\nhad been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most\nslightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, and\nthe honours which were hereafter to be his own.

She knew,\nthat when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the heavy\nbills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr Shepherd, his\nagent, from his thoughts. The Kellynch property was good, but not equal\nto Sir Walter’s apprehension of the state required in its possessor.\nWhile Lady Elliot lived, there had been method, moderation, and\neconomy, which had just kept him within his income; but with her had\ndied all such right-mindedness, and from that period he had been\nconstantly exceeding it. It had not been possible for him to spend\nless; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously\ncalled on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only growing\ndreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it became vain\nto attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his daughter. He\nhad given her some hints of it the last spring in town; he had gone so\nfar even as to say, “Can we retrench? Does it occur to you that there\nis any one article in which we can retrench?” and Elizabeth, to do her\njustice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm, set seriously to\nthink what could be done, and had finally proposed these two branches\nof economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from\nnew furnishing the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards\nadded the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne, as had\nbeen the usual yearly custom. But these measures, however good in\nthemselves, were insufficient for the real extent of the evil, the\nwhole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon\nafterwards. Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy. She\nfelt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her father; and they were\nneither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses\nwithout compromising their dignity, or relinquishing their comforts in\na way not to be borne."

She was a\nbenevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of strong attachments,\nmost correct in her conduct, strict in her notions of decorum, and with\nmanners that were held a standard of good-breeding. She had a\ncultivated mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and\nconsistent—but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry; she had a\nvalue for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little to the\nfaults of those who possessed them. Herself the widow of only a knight,\nshe gave the dignity of a baronet all its due; and Sir Walter,\nindependent of his claims as an old acquaintance, an attentive\nneighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her very dear friend,\nthe father of Anne and her sisters, was, as being Sir Walter, in her\napprehension, entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration\nunder his present difficulties."

A man is in\ngreater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose\nfather, his father might have disdained to speak to, and of becoming\nprematurely an object of disgust himself, than in any other line. One\nday last spring, in town, I was in company with two men, striking\ninstances of what I am talking of; Lord St Ives, whose father we all\nknow to have been a country curate, without bread to eat; I was to give\nplace to Lord St Ives, and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most\ndeplorable-looking personage you can imagine; his face the colour of\nmahogany, rough and rugged to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles,\nnine grey hairs of a side, and nothing but a dab of powder at top. ‘In\nthe name of heaven, who is that old fellow?’ said I to a friend of mine\nwho was standing near, (Sir Basil Morley). ‘Old fellow!’ cried Sir\nBasil, ‘it is Admiral Baldwin. What do you take his age to be?’\n‘Sixty,’ said I, ‘or perhaps sixty-two.’ ‘Forty,’ replied Sir Basil,\n‘forty, and no more.’ Picture to yourselves my amazement; I shall not\neasily forget Admiral Baldwin. I never saw quite so wretched an example\nof what a sea-faring life can do; but to a degree, I know it is the\nsame with them all: they are all knocked about, and exposed to every\nclimate, and every weather, till they are not fit to be seen. It is a\npity they are not knocked on the head at once, before they reach\nAdmiral Baldwin’s age.”"

A lady, without a family, was the very\nbest preserver of furniture in the world. He had seen Mrs Croft, too;\nshe was at Taunton with the admiral, and had been present almost all\nthe time they were talking the matter over."

She was\npersuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing: indiscreet,\nimproper, hardly capable of success, and not deserving it. But it was\nnot a merely selfish caution, under which she acted, in putting an end\nto it. Had she not imagined herself consulting his good, even more than\nher own, she could hardly have given him up. The belief of being\nprudent, and self-denying, principally for _his_ advantage, was her\nchief consolation, under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and\nevery consolation was required, for she had to encounter all the\nadditional pain of opinions, on his side, totally unconvinced and\nunbending, and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a\nrelinquishment.

No one had ever come within the Kellynch\ncircle, who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth, as he\nstood in her memory. No second attachment, the only thoroughly natural,\nhappy, and sufficient cure, at her time of life, had been possible to\nthe nice tone of her mind, the fastidiousness of her taste, in the\nsmall limits of the society around them. She had been solicited, when\nabout two-and-twenty, to change her name, by the young man, who not\nlong afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister; and\nLady Russell had lamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrove was the\neldest son of a man, whose landed property and general importance were\nsecond in that country, only to Sir Walter’s, and of good character and\nappearance; and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something\nmore, while Anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at\ntwenty-two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice\nof her father’s house, and settled so permanently near herself. But in\nthis case, Anne had left nothing for advice to do; and though Lady\nRussell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion, never wished the\npast undone, she began now to have the anxiety which borders on\nhopelessness for Anne’s being tempted, by some man of talents and\nindependence, to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly\nfitted by her warm affections and domestic habits."

She did not blame\nLady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;\nbut she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances, to\napply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such certain\nimmediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good. She was persuaded\nthat under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home, and every\nanxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears, delays, and\ndisappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman in\nmaintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it;\nand this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than\nthe usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,\nwithout reference to the actual results of their case, which, as it\nhappened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be\nreasonably calculated on. All his sanguine expectations, all his\nconfidence had been justified. His genius and ardour had seemed to\nforesee and to command his prosperous path.

She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell’s motives\nin this, over those of her father and Elizabeth; she could honour all\nthe better feelings of her calmness; but the general air of oblivion\namong them was highly important from whatever it sprung; and in the\nevent of Admiral Croft’s really taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew\nover the conviction which had always been most grateful to her, of the\npast being known to those three only among her connexions, by whom no\nsyllable, she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that\namong his, the brother only with whom he had been residing, had\nreceived any information of their short-lived engagement.

It would be most right, and most\nwise, and, therefore must involve least suffering to go with the\nothers."

Mrs Clay had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy\nwrist, which he was continually making severe remarks upon, in her\nabsence; but she was young, and certainly altogether well-looking, and\npossessed, in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely\nmore dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been.\nAnne was so impressed by the degree of their danger, that she could not\nexcuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister.

If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman,\nI grant you, it might be wrong to have her so much with me; not that\nanything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make a\ndegrading match, but he might be rendered unhappy. But poor Mrs Clay\nwho, with all her merits, can never have been reckoned tolerably\npretty, I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect\nsafety.

To the Great House accordingly they\nwent, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,\nwith a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present daughters\nof the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a\ngrand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables placed in\nevery direction. Oh! could the originals of the portraits against the\nwainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue\nsatin have seen what was going on, have been conscious of such an\noverthrow of all order and neatness! The portraits themselves seemed to\nbe staring in astonishment."

Mr and Mrs Musgrove were a very\ngood sort of people; friendly and hospitable, not much educated, and\nnot at all elegant. Their children had more modern minds and manners.\nThere was a numerous family; but the only two grown up, excepting\nCharles, were Henrietta and Louisa, young ladies of nineteen and\ntwenty, who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock of\naccomplishments, and were now like thousands of other young ladies,\nliving to be fashionable, happy, and merry. Their dress had every\nadvantage, their faces were rather pretty, their spirits extremely\ngood, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant; they were of consequence\nat home, and favourites abroad. Anne always contemplated them as some\nof the happiest creatures of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we\nall are, by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for\nthe possibility of exchange, she would not have given up her own more\nelegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them\nnothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement\ntogether, that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known\nso little herself with either of her sisters."

As it was, he did nothing with\nmuch zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise trifled away, without\nbenefit from books or anything else. He had very good spirits, which\nnever seemed much affected by his wife’s occasional lowness, bore with\nher unreasonableness sometimes to Anne’s admiration, and upon the\nwhole, though there was very often a little disagreement (in which she\nhad sometimes more share than she wished, being appealed to by both\nparties), they might pass for a happy couple. They were always\nperfectly agreed in the want of more money, and a strong inclination\nfor a handsome present from his father; but here, as on most topics, he\nhad the superiority, for while Mary thought it a great shame that such\na present was not made, he always contended for his father’s having\nmany other uses for his money, and a right to spend it as he liked."

And one day when\nAnne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them after talking of\nrank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said, “I have no scruple of\nobserving to _you_, how nonsensical some persons are about their place,\nbecause all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it;\nbut I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would be a great deal\nbetter if she were not so very tenacious, especially if she would not\nbe always putting herself forward to take place of mamma.

I will tell you why she is out of spirits.\nWhen the Crofts called this morning, (they called here afterwards, did\nnot they?), they happened to say, that her brother, Captain Wentworth,\nis just returned to England, or paid off, or something, and is coming\nto see them almost directly; and most unluckily it came into mamma’s\nhead, when they were gone, that Wentworth, or something very like it,\nwas the name of poor Richard’s captain at one time; I do not know when\nor where, but a great while before he died, poor fellow! And upon\nlooking over his letters and things, she found it was so, and is\nperfectly sure that this must be the very man, and her head is quite\nfull of it, and of poor Richard! So we must be as merry as we can, that\nshe may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things.”"

And it was soon over. In\ntwo minutes after Charles’s preparation, the others appeared; they were\nin the drawing-room. Her eye half met Captain Wentworth’s, a bow, a\ncurtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary, said all that\nwas right, said something to the Miss Musgroves, enough to mark an easy\nfooting; the room seemed full, full of persons and voices, but a few\nminutes ended it. Charles shewed himself at the window, all was ready,\ntheir visitor had bowed and was gone, the Miss Musgroves were gone too,\nsuddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the\nsportsmen: the room was cleared, and Anne might finish her breakfast as\nshe could."

Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for\nHenrietta, but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be\nextremely delightful."

The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty\nacres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the best land in\nthe country. I grant you, that any of them but Charles would be a very\nshocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it could not be; he is the\nonly one that could be possible; but he is a very good-natured, good\nsort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands, he will\nmake a different sort of place of it, and live in a very different sort\nof way; and with that property, he will never be a contemptible\nman—good, freehold property.

She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly\nestranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope, and\nleave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross: but there was\nsuch a change as became very alarming, when such a man as Captain\nWentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause. He had been absent\nonly two Sundays, and when they parted, had left her interested, even\nto the height of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his\npresent curacy, and obtaining that of Uppercross instead. It had then\nseemed the object nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who\nfor more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties\nof his office, but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should\nbe quite fixed on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as\ngood as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of\nit. The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of\ngoing six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better\ncuracy; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr\nShirley’s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get\nthrough without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to\nLouisa, but had been almost everything to Henrietta. When he came back,\nalas! the zeal of the business was gone by. Louisa could not listen at\nall to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr\nShirley: she was at a window, looking out for Captain Wentworth; and\neven Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed\nto have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the\nnegotiation."

Her _pleasure_ in the walk must arise from\nthe exercise and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the year\nupon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges, and from repeating to\nherself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of\nautumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind\nof taste and tenderness, that season which had drawn from every poet,\nworthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of\nfeeling. She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings\nand quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach of\nCaptain Wentworth’s conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves, she\nshould not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable. It\nwas mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate\nfooting, might fall into. He was more engaged with Louisa than with\nHenrietta. Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her\nsister. This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech\nof Louisa’s which struck her.

He had been engaged to Captain\nHarville’s sister, and was now mourning her loss. They had been a year\nor two waiting for fortune and promotion. Fortune came, his prize-money\nas lieutenant being great; promotion, too, came at _last;_ but Fanny\nHarville did not live to know it. She had died the preceding summer\nwhile he was at sea. Captain Wentworth believed it impossible for man\nto be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to Fanny\nHarville, or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change. He\nconsidered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily,\nuniting very strong feelings with quiet, serious, and retiring manners,\nand a decided taste for reading, and sedentary pursuits. To finish the\ninterest of the story, the friendship between him and the Harvilles\nseemed, if possible, augmented by the event which closed all their\nviews of alliance, and Captain Benwick was now living with them\nentirely. Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a year;\nhis taste, and his health, and his fortune, all directing him to a\nresidence inexpensive, and by the sea; and the grandeur of the country,\nand the retirement of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to\nCaptain Benwick’s state of mind. The sympathy and good-will excited\ntowards Captain Benwick was very great."

The varieties in the fitting-up of the\nrooms, where the common necessaries provided by the owner, in the\ncommon indifferent plight, were contrasted with some few articles of a\nrare species of wood, excellently worked up, and with something curious\nand valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had\nvisited, were more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with\nhis profession, the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence\non his habits, the picture of repose and domestic happiness it\npresented, made it to her a something more, or less, than\ngratification."

There can be no doubt of its having been of\nthe greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness, last spring\ntwelvemonth. He declares himself, that coming to Lyme for a month, did\nhim more good than all the medicine he took; and that being by the\nsea always makes him feel young again. Now, I cannot help thinking it\na pity that he does not live entirely by the sea. I do think he had\nbetter leave Uppercross entirely, and fix at Lyme. Do not you, Anne? Do\nnot you agree with me, that it is the best thing he could do, both for\nhimself and Mrs Shirley? She has cousins here, you know, and many\nacquaintance, which would make it cheerful for her, and I am sure she\nwould be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance\nat hand, in case of his having another seizure. Indeed I think it quite\nmelancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley, who\nhave been doing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a\nplace like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out\nfrom all the world. I wish his friends would propose it to him. I\nreally think they ought. And, as to procuring a dispensation, there\ncould be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character. My\nonly doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.\nHe is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous I\nmust say. Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous? Do not\nyou think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience, when a clergyman\nsacrifices his health for the sake of duties, which may be just as well\nperformed by another person? And at Lyme too, only seventeen miles off,\nhe would be near enough to hear, if people thought there was anything\nto complain of.”"

Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.

They had left Louisa beginning to sit up; but her head,\nthough clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves susceptible to the\nhighest extreme of tenderness; and though she might be pronounced to be\naltogether doing very well, it was still impossible to say when she\nmight be able to bear the removal home; and her father and mother, who\nmust return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas\nholidays, had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them."

She had been\ntaken to Charmouth too, and she had bathed, and she had gone to church,\nand there were a great many more people to look at in the church at\nLyme than at Uppercross; and all this, joined to the sense of being so\nvery useful, had made really an agreeable fortnight."

Anne had always felt that she\nwould pretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of\nthe others was unlooked for. They were evidently in excellent spirits,\nand she was soon to listen to the causes. They had no inclination to\nlisten to her. After laying out for some compliments of being deeply\nregretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay, they\nhad only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be all\ntheir own. Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little: it was\nall Bath."

Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after.\nEverybody was wanting to visit them. They had drawn back from many\nintroductions, and still were perpetually having cards left by people\nof whom they knew nothing."

Upon the hint of having spoken\ndisrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours, he\nwas quite indignant. He, who had ever boasted of being an Elliot, and\nwhose feelings, as to connection, were only too strict to suit the\nunfeudal tone of the present day. He was astonished, indeed, but his\ncharacter and general conduct must refute it. He could refer Sir Walter\nto all who knew him; and certainly, the pains he had been taking on\nthis, the first opportunity of reconciliation, to be restored to the\nfooting of a relation and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his\nopinions on the subject."

A\nvery fine woman with a large fortune, in love with him!

All that sounded extravagant or\nirrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin\nbut in the language of the relators. Still, however, she had the\nsensation of there being something more than immediately appeared, in\nMr Elliot’s wishing, after an interval of so many years, to be well\nreceived by them. In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain by being on\nterms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance. In all\nprobability he was already the richer of the two, and the Kellynch\nestate would as surely be his hereafter as the title. A sensible man,\nand he had looked like a very sensible man, why should it be an object\nto him? She could only offer one solution; it was, perhaps, for\nElizabeth’s sake. There might really have been a liking formerly,\nthough convenience and accident had drawn him a different way; and now\nthat he could afford to please himself, he might mean to pay his\naddresses to her. Elizabeth was certainly very handsome, with\nwell-bred, elegant manners, and her character might never have been\npenetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public, and when very young\nhimself. How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation\nof his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a\nfearful one. Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice,\nor too observant if Elizabeth were his object; and that Elizabeth was\ndisposed to believe herself so, and that her friend Mrs Clay was\nencouraging the idea, seemed apparent by a glance or two between them,\nwhile Mr Elliot’s frequent visits were talked of."

Sir Walter thought\nmuch of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be an excessively pretty woman,\nbeautiful. “He longed to see her. He hoped she might make some amends\nfor the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the\nstreets. The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women. He did\nnot mean to say that there were no pretty women, but the number of the\nplain was out of all proportion. He had frequently observed, as he\nwalked, that one handsome face would be followed by thirty, or\nfive-and-thirty frights; and once, as he had stood in a shop on Bond\nStreet, he had counted eighty-seven women go by, one after another,\nwithout there being a tolerable face among them. It had been a frosty\nmorning, to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a\nthousand could stand the test of. But still, there certainly were a\ndreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men! they were\ninfinitely worse. Such scarecrows as the streets were full of! It was\nevident how little the women were used to the sight of anything\ntolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced. He\nhad never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis (who was a\nfine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing that every\nwoman’s eye was upon him; every woman’s eye was sure to be upon Colonel\nWallis.” Modest Sir Walter! He was not allowed to escape, however. His\ndaughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting that Colonel Wallis’s companion\nmight have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis, and certainly was not\nsandy-haired."

In Lady\nRussell’s view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot, at a mature\ntime of life, should feel it a most desirable object, and what would\nvery generally recommend him among all sensible people, to be on good\nterms with the head of his family; the simplest process in the world of\ntime upon a head naturally clear, and only erring in the heyday of\nyouth. Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it, and at last to\nmention “Elizabeth.” Lady Russell listened, and looked, and made only\nthis cautious reply:—“Elizabeth! very well; time will explain.”"

Mr Elliot, too, it\nmust be remembered, had not been a widower seven months. A little delay\non his side might be very excusable. In fact, Anne could never see the\ncrape round his hat, without fearing that she was the inexcusable one,\nin attributing to him such imaginations; for though his marriage had\nnot been very happy, still it had existed so many years that she could\nnot comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its\nbeing dissolved."

No letter of\ncondolence had been sent to Ireland. The neglect had been visited on\nthe head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself, no\nletter of condolence was received at Kellynch, and, consequently, there\nwas but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the\nrelationship as closed. How to have this anxious business set to\nrights, and be admitted as cousins again, was the question: and it was\na question which, in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor\nMr Elliot thought unimportant. “Family connexions were always worth\npreserving, good company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken\na house, for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in\nstyle. She had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had heard\nher spoken of as a charming woman. It was very desirable that the\nconnexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any\ncompromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots.”"

Then she had, indeed, been a pitiable\nobject; for she had caught cold on the journey, and had hardly taken\npossession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and\nsuffering under severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers,\nwith the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances at\nthat moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense. She\nhad weathered it, however, and could truly say that it had done her\ngood. It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in\ngood hands. She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or\ndisinterested attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her\nthat her landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use her\nill; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister\nof her landlady, a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in\nthat house when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to\nattend her. “And she,” said Mrs Smith, “besides nursing me most\nadmirably, has really proved an invaluable acquaintance. As soon as I\ncould use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great\namusement; and she put me in the way of making these little\nthread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so\nbusy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little good\nto one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood. She had a large\nacquaintance, of course professionally, among those who can afford to\nbuy, and she disposes of my merchandise. She always takes the right\ntime for applying. Everybody’s heart is open, you know, when they have\nrecently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering the blessing of\nhealth, and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to speak. She is a\nshrewd, intelligent, sensible woman. Hers is a line for seeing human\nnature; and she has a fund of good sense and observation, which, as a\ncompanion, make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who\nhaving only received ‘the best education in the world,’ know nothing\nworth attending to. Call it gossip, if you will, but when Nurse Rooke\nhas half an hour’s leisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have\nsomething to relate that is entertaining and profitable: something that\nmakes one know one’s species better. One likes to hear what is going\non, to be _au fait_ as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly.\nTo me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I assure you, is a\ntreat.”"

Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one\nmorning from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple\nfor the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that\nevening in Westgate Buildings. She was not sorry for the excuse. They\nwere only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being kept at\nhome by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship which had\nbeen so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account with great\nalacrity—“She was engaged to spend the evening with an old\nschoolfellow.” They were not much interested in anything relative to\nAnne; but still there were questions enough asked, to make it\nunderstood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth was\ndisdainful, and Sir Walter severe."

Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could\nsupply from Lady Russell. To her, its greatest interest must be, in\nhaving been very much talked of between her friend and Mr Elliot; in\nhaving been wished for, regretted, and at the same time honoured for\nstaying away in such a cause. Her kind, compassionate visits to this\nold schoolfellow, sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr\nElliot.

He could meet even Lady\nRussell in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be given to\nunderstand so much by her friend, could not know herself to be so\nhighly rated by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable\nsensations which her friend meant to create."

You must be a great deal too\nhappy to care for Uppercross, which, as you well know, affords little\nto write about. We have had a very dull Christmas; Mr and Mrs Musgrove\nhave not had one dinner party all the holidays. I do not reckon the\nHayters as anybody. The holidays, however, are over at last: I believe\nno children ever had such long ones. I am sure I had not. The house was\ncleared yesterday, except of the little Harvilles; but you will be\nsurprised to hear they have never gone home. Mrs Harville must be an\nodd mother to part with them so long. I do not understand it. They are\nnot at all nice children, in my opinion; but Mrs Musgrove seems to like\nthem quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren. What\ndreadful weather we have had! It may not be felt in Bath, with your\nnice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence. I have\nnot had a creature call on me since the second week in January, except\nCharles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome.\nBetween ourselves, I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at\nLyme as long as Louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way.\nThe carriage is gone to-day, to bring Louisa and the Harvilles\nto-morrow. We are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day\nafter, Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey,\nwhich is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of\nher; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there\nto-morrow. I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable, and wish I could\nbe acquainted with him too; but I have my usual luck: I am always out\nof the way when any thing desirable is going on; always the last of my\nfamily to be noticed. What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying\nwith Elizabeth! Does she never mean to go away? But perhaps if she were\nto leave the room vacant, we might not be invited. Let me know what you\nthink of this. I do not expect my children to be asked, you know. I can\nleave them at the Great House very well, for a month or six weeks. I\nhave this moment heard that the Crofts are going to Bath almost\nimmediately; they think the Admiral gouty. Charles heard it quite by\nchance; they have not had the civility to give me any notice, or of\noffering to take anything. I do not think they improve at all as\nneighbours. We see nothing of them, and this is really an instance of\ngross inattention. Charles joins me in love, and everything proper.\nYours affectionately,"

The Admiral does not seem very ill, and I sincerely\nhope Bath will do him all the good he wants. I shall be truly glad to\nhave them back again. Our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant\nfamily. But now for Louisa. I have something to communicate that will\nastonish you not a little. She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very\nsafely, and in the evening we went to ask her how she did, when we were\nrather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had\nbeen invited as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the\nreason? Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa, and\nnot choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr\nMusgrove; for it was all settled between him and her before she came\naway, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville. True, upon\nmy honour! Are not you astonished? I shall be surprised at least if you\never received a hint of it, for I never did. Mrs Musgrove protests\nsolemnly that she knew nothing of the matter. We are all very well\npleased, however, for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain\nWentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr Musgrove\nhas written his consent, and Captain Benwick is expected to-day. Mrs\nHarville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister’s\naccount; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite with both. Indeed,\nMrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having\nnursed her. Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say; but if you\nremember, I never thought him attached to Louisa; I never could see\nanything of it. And this is the end, you see, of Captain Benwick’s\nbeing supposed to be an admirer of yours. How Charles could take such a\nthing into his head was always incomprehensible to me. I hope he will\nbe more agreeable now. Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove,\nbut a million times better than marrying among the Hayters.”"

Where could have been the attraction? The\nanswer soon presented itself. It had been in situation. They had been\nthrown together several weeks; they had been living in the same small\nfamily party: since Henrietta’s coming away, they must have been\ndepending almost entirely on each other, and Louisa, just recovering\nfrom illness, had been in an interesting state, and Captain Benwick was\nnot inconsolable. That was a point which Anne had not been able to\navoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as\nMary, from the present course of events, they served only to confirm\nthe idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself.\nShe did not mean, however, to derive much more from it to gratify her\nvanity, than Mary might have allowed. She was persuaded that any\ntolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for\nhim would have received the same compliment. He had an affectionate\nheart. He must love somebody."

Whoever\nsuffered inconvenience, she must suffer none, but it occupied a little\ntime to settle the point of civility between the other two. The rain\nwas a mere trifle, and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with\nMr Elliot. But the rain was also a mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would\nhardly allow it even to drop at all, and her boots were so thick! much\nthicker than Miss Anne’s; and, in short, her civility rendered her\nquite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be,\nand it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so\ndetermined, that the others were obliged to settle it for them; Miss\nElliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already, and Mr\nElliot deciding on appeal, that his cousin Anne’s boots were rather the\nthickest."

He was more obviously struck and confused\nby the sight of her than she had ever observed before; he looked quite\nred. For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance, she felt\nthat she was betraying the least sensibility of the two. She had the\nadvantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments. All the\noverpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects of strong surprise\nwere over with her. Still, however, she had enough to feel!

This,\nthough late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet better than\nnothing, and her spirits improved."

She could not do so, without\ncomparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles; but\nstill she did it, and not with much happier effect; though by what\nseemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next\nneighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench before the\nconcert closed."

He saw her too;\nyet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow\ndegrees came at last near enough to speak to her. She felt that\nsomething must be the matter. The change was indubitable. The\ndifference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon\nRoom was strikingly great. Why was it? She thought of her father, of\nLady Russell. Could there have been any unpleasant glances? He began by\nspeaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain Wentworth of\nUppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing; and in\nshort, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over. Anne\nreplied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well, and yet in\nallowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance\nimproved, and he replied again with almost a smile. They talked for a\nfew minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down towards the\nbench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying; when at that\nmoment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round. It came from\nMr Elliot. He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to, to explain\nItalian again. Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of\nwhat was next to be sung. Anne could not refuse; but never had she\nsacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit."

He will not be led astray; he will not be misled\nby others to his ruin.”"

However, I have determined; I think I am\nright; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot’s real\ncharacter. Though I fully believe that, at present, you have not the\nsmallest intention of accepting him, there is no saying what may\nhappen. You might, some time or other, be differently affected towards\nhim. Hear the truth, therefore, now, while you are unprejudiced. Mr\nElliot is a man without heart or conscience; a designing, wary,\ncold-blooded being, who thinks only of himself; whom for his own\ninterest or ease, would be guilty of any cruelty, or any treachery,\nthat could be perpetrated without risk of his general character. He has\nno feeling for others. Those whom he has been the chief cause of\nleading into ruin, he can neglect and desert without the smallest\ncompunction. He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice\nor compassion. Oh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!”"

At nineteen, you know, one does not think very seriously; but\nMr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others, and much more\nagreeable than most others, and we were almost always together. We were\nprincipally in town, living in very good style. He was then the\ninferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one; he had chambers in\nthe Temple, and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance\nof a gentleman. He had always a home with us whenever he chose it; he\nwas always welcome; he was like a brother. My poor Charles, who had the\nfinest, most generous spirit in the world, would have divided his last\nfarthing with him; and I know that his purse was open to him; I know\nthat he often assisted him.”"

Now you are to understand, that time\nhad worked a very material change in Mr Elliot’s opinions as to the\nvalue of a baronetcy. Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a\ncompletely altered man. Having long had as much money as he could\nspend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he has\nbeen gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is\nheir to. I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it\nis now a confirmed feeling. He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir\nWilliam. You may guess, therefore, that the news he heard from his\nfriend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced;\nthe resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of\nfixing himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his former\nacquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might give\nhim the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of\ncircumventing the lady if he found it material. This was agreed upon\nbetween the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel\nWallis was to assist in every way that he could. He was to be\nintroduced, and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was to\nbe introduced. Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was\nforgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it\nwas his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival added\nanother motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay. He omitted no\nopportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way, called at\nall hours; but I need not be particular on this subject. You can\nimagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide, perhaps, may\nrecollect what you have seen him do.”"

A\nscheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis’s understanding, by all accounts; but my\nsensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it. ‘Why, to be sure,\nma’am,’ said she, ‘it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.’\nAnd, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart, is a\nvery strenuous opposer of Sir Walter’s making a second match.

She was concerned for the disappointment and\npain Lady Russell would be feeling; for the mortifications which must\nbe hanging over her father and sister, and had all the distress of\nforeseeing many evils, without knowing how to avert any one of them.\nShe was most thankful for her own knowledge of him. She had never\nconsidered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old\nfriend like Mrs Smith, but here was a reward indeed springing from it!\nMrs Smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done.\nCould the knowledge have been extended through her family? But this was\na vain idea. She must talk to Lady Russell, tell her, consult with her,\nand having done her best, wait the event with as much composure as\npossible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be in\nthat quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell; in\nthat flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself."

In the centre of some\nof the best preserves in the kingdom, surrounded by three great\nproprietors, each more careful and jealous than the other; and to two\nof the three at least, Charles Hayter might get a special\nrecommendation.

It was a struggle\nbetween propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better, and then\nElizabeth was happy again. These were her internal persuasions: “Old\nfashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess to give\ndinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does; did not even\nask her own sister’s family, though they were here a month: and I dare\nsay it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove; put her quite out of\nher way. I am sure she would rather not come; she cannot feel easy with\nus. I will ask them all for an evening; that will be much better; that\nwill be a novelty and a treat. They have not seen two such drawing\nrooms before. They will be delighted to come to-morrow evening. It\nshall be a regular party, small, but most elegant.” And this satisfied\nElizabeth: and when the invitation was given to the two present, and\npromised for the absent, Mary was as completely satisfied. She was\nparticularly asked to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady\nDalrymple and Miss Carteret, who were fortunately already engaged to\ncome; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention. Miss\nElliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course\nof the morning; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go and\nsee her and Henrietta directly."

One five minutes\nbrought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there half an\nhour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was, seemed more than half\nfilled: a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove,\nand Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth. The\nappearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the\nmoment. It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this\narrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together\nagain. Their last meeting had been most important in opening his\nfeelings; she had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she\nfeared from his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had\nhastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed. He did not\nseem to want to be near enough for conversation."

We are not boy and girl, to be captiously\nirritable, misled by every moment’s inadvertence, and wantonly playing\nwith our own happiness.” And yet, a few minutes afterwards, she felt as\nif their being in company with each other, under their present\ncircumstances, could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and\nmisconstructions of the most mischievous kind."

She had promised to be with the Musgroves from\nbreakfast to dinner. Her faith was plighted, and Mr Elliot’s character,\nlike the Sultaness Scheherazade’s head, must live another day."

When she reached the White Hart, and made her way to\nthe proper apartment, she found herself neither arriving quite in time,\nnor the first to arrive. The party before her were, Mrs Musgrove,\ntalking to Mrs Croft, and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and\nshe immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait,\nhad gone out the moment it had cleared, but would be back again soon,\nand that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to\nkeep her there till they returned. She had only to submit, sit down, be\noutwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once in all the\nagitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little\nbefore the morning closed. There was no delay, no waste of time. She\nwas deep in the happiness of such misery, or the misery of such\nhappiness, instantly. Two minutes after her entering the room, Captain\nWentworth said—"

Anne felt that\nshe did not belong to the conversation, and yet, as Captain Harville\nseemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk, she could not avoid hearing\nmany undesirable particulars; such as, “how Mr Musgrove and my brother\nHayter had met again and again to talk it over; what my brother Hayter\nhad said one day, and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what\nhad occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished,\nand what I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards\npersuaded to think might do very well,” and a great deal in the same\nstyle of open-hearted communication: minutiae which, even with every\nadvantage of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not\ngive, could be properly interesting only to the principals. Mrs Croft\nwas attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all, it\nwas very sensibly. Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much\nself-occupied to hear."

It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who\nhad never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace\nbusiness, too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne\nhad never found an evening shorter. Glowing and lovely in sensibility\nand happiness, and more generally admired than she thought about or\ncared for, she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature\naround her. Mr Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.\nThe Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them. Lady Dalrymple\nand Miss Carteret—they would soon be innoxious cousins to her. She\ncared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in the public\nmanners of her father and sister. With the Musgroves, there was the\nhappy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville, the kind-hearted\nintercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell, attempts at\nconversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short; with Admiral\nand Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest,\nwhich the same consciousness sought to conceal; and with Captain\nWentworth, some moments of communications continually occurring, and\nalways the hope of more, and always the knowledge of his being there."

But I mean,\nthat I was right in submitting to her, and that if I had done\notherwise, I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement\nthan I did even in giving it up, because I should have suffered in my\nconscience. I have now, as far as such a sentiment is allowable in\nhuman nature, nothing to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a\nstrong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman’s portion.”"

When any two young people take it\ninto their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance to\ncarry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent, or ever\nso little likely to be necessary to each other’s ultimate comfort. This\nmay be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be truth; and\nif such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and an Anne\nElliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind, consciousness of right,\nand one independent fortune between them, fail of bearing down every\nopposition? They might in fact, have borne down a great deal more than\nthey met with, for there was little to distress them beyond the want of\ngraciousness and warmth. Sir Walter made no objection, and Elizabeth\ndid nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned. Captain Wentworth,\nwith five-and-twenty thousand pounds, and as high in his profession as\nmerit and activity could place him, was no longer nobody. He was now\nesteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift\nbaronet, who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself\nin the situation in which Providence had placed him, and who could give\nhis daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand\npounds which must be hers hereafter."

This however was what Lady Russell had\nnow to do. She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with\nregard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in\neach; that because Captain Wentworth’s manners had not suited her own\nideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a\ncharacter of dangerous impetuosity; and that because Mr Elliot’s\nmanners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness,\ntheir general politeness and suavity, she had been too quick in\nreceiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and\nwell-regulated mind. There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do,\nthan to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong, and to take up\na new set of opinions and of hopes."
